\chapter*{Preface} \thispagestyle{empty} 

Textbooks customarily include an abundance of material and leave you
to figure out what to focus on. While there are compelling reasons to
present many examples in each section, such an approach can be
unsatisfactory for those who feel they need a more streamlined
source. The present text aims to support a different workflow: (i)
read the book for a minimalistic presentation of the core ideas, and
(ii) seek alternative sources for additional examples when needed. I
hope that you will be able to read each section carefully and work all
the examples and exercises, thereby wasting no effort on figuring out
what to skip. I recommend the following sources for more exercises,
discussion, or examples:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep = 3pt]
\item Appendix~\ref{sec:addexer}, which lists additional exercises by
  section. Some of these are original, and others are
  modified from exercises in 
  James Stewart's \textit{Multivariable Calculus} or Susan J.\ Colley's \textit{Vector
    Calculus}. 
\item The community calculus textbook, available at
  \texttt{communitycalculus.org}. This is an open source textbook available (for
  free) online, and it has \textit{a lot} of exercises. 
\item MathInsight (\url{mathinsight.org}) has webpages for many
  multivariable topics with nice exposition and some beautiful applets for exploring the
  ideas developed in this course. 
\item A standard multivariable calculus textbook.  
\item 3blue1brown, a math video creator with an excellent series on
  linear algebra. Unfortunately he hasn't done multivariable calculus
  yet, so these videos will only be available for the vector topics.

We visualize the set of \textbf{real numbers} (denoted by $\R$ or
$\R^1$) as a line, called the \textit{real number line}
(Figure~\ref{fig:real}).

The location of a number $x$ on this line is the point whose
\textit{signed} distance from 0 is $x$. The word \textit{signed} means
that distances measured from 0 to a point which is left of 0 count as
negative.

The set $\R^2$ of ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x$ and $y$ are real
numbers can be thought of as a \textit{plane}, since a point in a
plane can be specified by two real numbers: its signed distances from
two lines which meet at a right angle. These two lines are called the
$x$-axis and the $y$-axis (Figure~\ref{fig:plane}). 

The set $\R^3$ of ordered triples of real numbers $(x,y,z)$ can be
visualized as (3D) space, since a point in space can be specified by
three real numbers: its signed distances from three planes which meet
one another at right angles. These planes are called the $xy$-plane,
the $yz$-plane, and the $xz$-plane, and their lines of intersection
are called the $x$-axis, the $y$-axis, and the $z$-axis*
(Figure~\ref{fig:space}\sidenote{* Unless otherwise specified, we
  will draw our 3D axes with the positive $x$ direction to the left,
  the positive $y$ direction to the right, and the $z$ direction up,
  as shown in the figure}[-27mm]).

The set $\R^4$ is defined to be the set of ordered quadruples of real
numbers, and similarly for $\R^5, \R^6,$ and so on.  
\sidenote{* Since
  we live in three dimensions, spatial visualization of $\R^n$ only
  works for $n \leq 3$. We will use other visualization tools or
  reason by analogy to build intuition in $\R^n$ for $n \geq 4$} If
$n$ is a positive integer*, we refer to $\R^n$ as a \textbf{Euclidean
  space}. The superscript $n$
is called the \textbf{dimension} of $\R^n$.

\begin{exercise}[parbox=true]{}{absxy}
  Write down a formula for the distance on the number line between two 
  real numbers $x$ and $y$. Repeat for two points in the plane, and
  for two points in $\R^3$. 
\end{exercise}

\bang{4mm}
The \textbf{graph} of an equation in $\R^n$ is the set of all points
in $\R^n$ whose coordinates satisfy the equation. For example, the
graph of the equation $x + y = 1$ in $\R^2$ is a line. The graph of
$x^2 + y^2 = 1$ in $\R^3$ is a \textit{cylinder}, since a point
$(x,y,z)$ satisfies the equation if and only if it is directly above
or below a point on the unit circle in the $xy$-plane. Note that the
dimension of the Euclidean space under consideration must be
specified, since the equation need not involve all of the variables.

\begin{exercise}{}{equation_graphs}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a), leftmargin = 12pt, itemsep = 4pt]
  \item Describe the graph of the equation $x(x-1)(x+1) = 0$ in
    $\R^1$. 
  \item Interpret $x(x-1)(x+1) = 0$ as an equation in $\R^2$ and
    describe its graph. 
  \item Interpret $x(x-1)(x+1) = 0$ as an equation in $\R^3$ and
    describe its graph.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}


\section{Functions from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$} \label{sec:RntoRn}

\subsection{Visualizing functions}

A \textbf{function} from $\R^1$ to $\R^1$ takes a real number $x$ as
input and returns another real number, denoted $f(x)$, as output. We
can draw the \textbf{graph}* of such a function in $1 + 1 = 2$
dimensions, by associating the horizontal axis with input values and
the vertical axis with output values. For example, see
Figure~\ref{fig:squaring} for a graph of the squaring
function. \sidenote{* The graph of a function $f$ from $\R^1$ to
  $\R^1$ is defined to be the graph of the \textit{equation}
  $y = f(x)$. In other words, $(x,y)$ is on the graph if and only if
  the equation $y=f(x)$ is satisfied}[-1cm]

A function from $\R^2$ to $\R^1$ can be visualized in $2 + 1 = 3$
dimensions by using the $xy$-plane for the input values and the
$z$-axis for the output value. In other words, we plot every triple of
the form $(x,y,f(x,y))$ where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers. See
Figure~\ref{fig:exp} for a graph of $f(x) = \e^{-x^2 - y^2}$ over a
square-shaped region.

The graph of a function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ would require
$2 + 2 = 4$ dimensions to visualize, so we are out of luck
there. However, we can visualize a function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ by
drawing a picture of where all the grid lines go*---see
Figure~\ref{fig:gridlines}.\sidenote{* One way this method of
  visualization is different from graphing is that we separate the
  input values on the left side of the figure from the output values
  on the right side}

  \caption{A transformation from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ \label{fig:gridlines}}
\end{wrapfigure}

We often refer to a function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ as a
\textit{transformation}, which is a synonym of \textit{function}
but is meant to evoke this particular method of
visualization. Functions from $\R^3$ to $\R^3$ are also called
transformations and can be visualized in the same way, but for now we
will focus on transformations from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$.

A \textbf{level set} of a function is the set of all values in the
function's domain which map to a particular value in the codomain. For
example, the level sets of the function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ are
concentric circles, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:levelsets2}. The level
sets of $f(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 - z^2$ are surfaces, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:levelsets3}. Level sets are often called level curves
or level surfaces, as appropriate. A picture showing the level sets
corresponding to several equally spaced codomain values is called a
\textbf{contour plot}.

A function from $\R^2$ to $\R^1$ can be visualized using its graph or
using a contour plot, whereas the graph of a function from $\R^3$ to
$\R^1$ can't be visualized spatially. Thus contour plotting provides
an important visualization tool for functions of three variables.

Contour plots have some shortcomings: unless the output value
corresponding to each level set is identified using a labeling or
coloring scheme, information about the values of the function is
missing from the picture. In other words, graphing a function combines
input and output into a single figure, while level sets are drawn in
the function's \textit{domain} only*. \sidenote{* This means that
  Figure~\ref{fig:levelsets2} involves an abuse of notation: the level
  sets should be points in $\R^2$ rather than points in the $xy$-plane
  in $\R^3$. However, it is common practice to make such implicit use
  of the natural association $(x,y) \leftrightarrow (x,y,0)$ between
  $\R^2$ and the $xy$-plane}[-43mm]

\subsection{Linear transformations}

\vspace{-2mm} 

\sidenote{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE}{\tbob}
  on linear transformations}[-5.5mm]

\label{subsec:lintrans} 

\vspace{-2mm} 

One of the key ideas of differential calculus is to uses
\textit{linear} functions to approximate functions with curvy
graphs. This approximation is useful because (i) all differentiable
functions look increasingly linear as you zoom in around a point, and
(ii) linear functions are very simple. We will apply the same
principle in higher dimensions and use linear transformations to
approximate non-linear ones. Just as you learned about linear
functions before learning single-variable calculus, we will explore
linear transformations before discussing how differentiation
generalizes to the multivariable setting.

So what \textit{is} a linear function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$?
Single-variable functions of the form $f(x) = mx + b$, where $m$ and
$b$ are constants, are often called linear. However, we will take a
slightly different view by requiring $b = 0$, so that only functions
of the form $f(x) = mx$ are considered linear.* Our definition of
linearity in higher dimensions is analogous: only terms of the
form ``constant times variable'' are allowed: \sidenote{* Actually,
  this view is ubiquitous in mathematics, because the essence of
  linearity is the pair of properties $f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)$ and
  $f(ax) = af(x)$, and we only get these if we insist $b=0$}[-2cm]

\begin{defn}{Linearity}{def:linear2}
  A function $f$ from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ is \textbf{linear} if there
  exist* $a,b,c,d \in \R$ so that \sidenote{* This notation means that
    $a,b,c,d$ are in the set of real numbers}
  \[
    f(x,y) = (ax + by , cx + dy).

  \caption{Four linear transformations from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ \label{fig:four_trans}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:four_trans} shows four examples of linear
transformations from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$. The transformations in
Figure~\ref{fig:four_trans} \textit{scale}, \textit{shear},
\textit{rotate/scale}, and \textit{project}, respectively. Not shown
is a \textit{reflection}, such as $f(x,y) = (x,-y)$. This list is
complete in the sense that every linear transformation from $\R^2$ to
$\R^2$ can be written as a composition of transformations of these
basic types.

We might guess, based on Figure~\ref{fig:four_trans}, that linear
transformations map equally spaced lines to equally spaced lines,
where coincident lines count as equally spaced with a spacing of zero
(as in the last example). This is almost accurate: sometimes equally
spaced lines can map to equally spaced \textit{points}
(Exercise~\ref{exer:espoints}). The following theorem gives a
geometric characterization of linearity. 

\begin{theo}{}{equalspacing}
  A function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ is linear if and only if it maps
  the origin to the origin and equally spaced lines* to equally spaced
  lines or points. \sidenote{* \textit{Equally spaced lines} are lines
    which are parallel and for which the distances between consecutive
    lines are the same}
\end{theo}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Use Theorem~\ref{th:equalspacing} to show that if
  $f : \R^2 \to \R^2$ rotates every point counterclockwise about the
  origin by $30^\circ$, there necessarily exist $a,b,c,d\in\R$ such
  that $f(x,y) = (ax+ by, cx+ dy)$ for all $(x,y) \in\R^2$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{espoints}
  Show that the linear function $f(x,y)=(2x,0)$ maps any collection of
  equally spaced vertical lines to a collection of equally spaced points.
\end{exercise}

\section{The determinant} \label{sec:det} 

\sidenote{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip3X9LOh2dk}{\tbob}
  on the determinant}[-7.5mm]

The \textit{slope} of a linear function from $\R^1$ to $\R^1$ measures
how it distorts length. For example, the function $f(x) = 3x$ maps any
interval $[a,b]$ to the interval $[3a,3b]$ which is three times as
long. The function $g(x) = -\tfrac{1}{2}x$ maps any interval to an
interval which is half as long, and it also flips the interval
around. We can say that the absolute value of the slope of a linear
function is the \textit{factor by which lengths are transformed}, and
the sign of the slope tells us whether the function reverses the real
number line.

So, what's the corresponding idea for transformations from $\R^2$ to
$\R^2$? Can we look at a linear transformation and conveniently
calculate the factor by which that transformation distorts 
\textit{areas}? Yes!

For each linear transformation in Figure~\ref{fig:four_trans}, the
quadrilaterals on the image side of the picture are all
congruent. This suggests that the linear transformation does indeed
transform every area by the same factor. Taking this fact as given, it
suffices for us to consider the image of a single square, which we
will take to be $[0,1]^2$, the set of points both of whose coordinates
are between 0 and 1.

\begin{example}{}{det2}
  Find the area of the image of the unit square $[0,1]^2$ under the
  transformation
  \[
    f(x,y) = (ax + by, cx + dy).
  \] 
  \begin{center} 
    \begin{asy} 
      size(10cm);
      settings.outformat="pdf";
      draw((0,2)--(0,0)--(2,0),Arrows());
      filldraw(box((0,0),(1,1)),lightgray);
      draw("$1$",(1,0),align=S);
      draw("$1$",(0,1),align=W);
      draw(shift((3,0))*((0,2)--(0,0)--(2,0)),Arrows());
      filldraw(shift((3,0))*((0,0)--(2,1)--(3,2)--(1,1)--cycle),lightgray);
      dot("$(a,c)$",shift((3,0))*(2,1),align=SE);
      dot("$(b,d)$",shift((3,0))*(1,1),align=NW);
    \end{asy}
  \end{center}
\end{example} 

\begin{solution}
  The area of the unit square can be calculated by filling in some
  triangles to get a complete rectangle, as follows:
  \begin{center} 
    \begin{asy} 
      size(6cm);
      draw(((0,2.3)--(0,0)--(3.3,0)),Arrows());
      filldraw(((0,0)--(2,1)--(3,2)--(1,1)--cycle),lightgray);
      dot("$(a,c)$",(2,1),align=2*E);
      dot("$(b,d)$",(1,1),align=2*W);
      dot("$(a+b,c+d)$",(3,2),align=2*E);
      filldraw((0,0)--(3,0)--(2,1)--cycle,LightSeaGreen+opacity(0.5));
      filldraw((0,2)--(1,1)--(3,2)--cycle,LightSeaGreen+opacity(0.5));
      filldraw((0,0)--(1,1)--(0,2)--cycle,LightBlue+opacity(0.5));
      filldraw((3,0)--(2,1)--(3,2)--cycle,LightBlue+opacity(0.5));
    \end{asy}
  \end{center} 
  The area of the larger rectangle is $(a+b)(c+d)$, and the total area
  of the triangles we added is
  $2\cdot\tfrac{1}{2} (a+b)(c) + 2\cdot\tfrac{1}{2}
  (c+d)(b)$. Subtracting, we get that the area of the parallelogram is
  $ad - bc$.

  We are not quite finished, however. Note that we assumed in our
  diagram that the line segment from the origin to $(a,c)$ is
  clockwise from the line segment from the origin to $(b,d)$. If we
  switched these line segments around, the same reasoning would have
  given us the formula $bc - ad$. We can put this all together by saying
  that the factor by which areas are transformed is $\boxed{|ad - bc|}$.
\end{solution}

We can interpret the result of Example~\ref{exam:det2} as follows:
$ad - bc$ tells us how $f(x,y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)$ transforms areas
(via its absolute value) and whether applying $f$ to the three points
$(0,0)$, $(1,0)$, and $(0,1)$ reverses their orientation* (via its
sign). This idea is important enough to deserve its own name. To
simplify the definition, we refer to length as $1$-dimensional volume
and area as 2-dimensional volume. \sidenote{* Reversing the
  orientation of three points $A$, $B$, and $C$ means that if these
  points are given in counterclockwise order around the triangle
  $ABC$, then their images are in clockwise order around the triangle
  they form}[-4cm]

\begin{defn}{Determinant }{def:det} \bang{-5mm}
  The \textbf{determinant} of a linear transformation from $\R^n$ to
  $\R^n$ is the signed factor by which it transforms $n$-dimensional
  volumes. 
\end{defn}

We have already figured out that the determinant of $f(x) = mx$ from
$\R^1$ to $\R^1$ is the slope $m$, and the determinant of a function
$f(x,y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)$ from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ is given by the
formula $ad - bc$.

For convenience, we sometimes represent a linear function by arranging
its coefficients into a grid of numbers called a \textit{matrix}. By
convention, rows correspond to coordinates of the output of the
function, and columns correspond to the variables. So, for example,
$f(x,y) = (ax + by, cx + dy)$ is represented by the matrix
$\left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array}\right]$. So we
have
\[
  \det [m] = m, \text{ and} \qquad \det \left[\begin{array}{cc} a & b \\ c & d \end{array}\right] = ad - bc. 
\]

\begin{exercise}{}{det}
  Find the determinant of each of the following matrices, and draw the
  image of the unit square under the corresponding linear
  transformations to see that the value of the determinant you
  computed makes sense.

  \pairofprobs{$\left[\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{array}\right]$}{
    $\left[\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{array}\right]$}

  \pairofprobs{$\left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{array}\right]$}{
    $\left[\begin{array}{cc} 2 & 1  \\ 4 & 2 \end{array}\right]$}
\end{exercise}

We define the determinant of a linear transformation 
\[
  f(x,y,z) = (ax + by + cz, \, dx + ey + fz,\, gx + hy  + iz)
\]
to be the product of two quantities:
\begin{enumerate}[(i),topsep=-6pt]
  \item the volume of the three-dimensional shape, called a
    \textit{parallelepiped}, whose vertices are the images under $f$
    of the vertices of the unit cube $[0,1]^3$
    (Figure~\ref{fig:3dlinear}).
  \item a factor of
    $\pm1$ which is equal to $-1$ if and only if the orientation of a
    small loop drawn on a face is reversed (see
    Figure~\ref{fig:3dlinear}), from the point of view of a small
    person standing on the solid with their head pointing toward the
    outside.

The formula for the determinant turns out to be*\sidenote{* The
  \textit{Geometry of Determinants} section of
  \href{http://joshua.smcvt.edu/linearalgebra/book.pdf}{the free
    online book \textit{Linear Algebra}} by Jim Hefferon includes a
  lengthy discussion of $n\times n$ determinants}
\[
  \det \left[
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i
    \end{array}
  \right] = 
  aei - afh - bdi + bfg + cdh - ceg. 
\]
Unlike the formula $ad - bc$ for the $2\times 2$ matrix, this formula
is not easy to memorize. Let's abbreviate $\det [ \hphantom{a} ]$ to
$| \hphantom{a}|$ and write this formula as
\[
  \left|\begin{array}{ccc} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{array}\right| = 
  +\hspace{2pt}a \left|\begin{array}{cc} e & f \\  h & i \end{array}\right| 
  -b \left|\begin{array}{cc} d & f \\  g & i \end{array}\right| 
  +c \left|\begin{array}{cc} d & e \\  g & h \end{array}\right|. 
\]
This formula is \textit{still} not easy to memorize, so let's break it
down: each term on the right-hand side includes three factors: (i) a $+1$ or
$-1$ which alternates starting with $+1$, (ii) an entry from the top
row (going from left to right), and (iii) the determinant of the matrix you
get when you remove the row and column of that entry from the original
matrix. These smaller matrices are called \textit{minors}, and this
method of calculating the determinant is called \textbf{expansion by
  minors} along the first row. You can also expand by minors along any
row or column (see Exercise~\ref{exer:det3b} below), but if it's an
even-numbered row or column, then the signs start with $-1$ instead of
$+1$.

\end{wrapfigure}
A \textbf{vector} in $\R^n$ is an arrow from one point in $\R^n$ (the
\textit{tail}) to another (the \textit{head}). See
Figure~\ref{fig:arrow}). The \textbf{length}* of a vector is the
distance from the head to the tail. Two vectors are considered
equivalent if they have the same length and the same direction. 
\sidenote{* The length of a vector is also called the
  \textbf{norm} or the \textbf{magnitude} of the vector}

The \textbf{components} of a vector are the coordinates of its head
when it is translated so that its tail is at the origin. In other
words, to find the components of a vector, we subtract each coordinate
of its tail from the corresponding coordinate of the head. The
components of the vector in Figure~\ref{fig:arrow} are
$\langle \frac{3}{2} , 1\rangle$---note that we use the pointy
brackets to distinguish components of a vector from coordinates of a
point.*\sidenote{* Actually, vectors and points kind of \textit{are}
  the same, since they are both specified by an ordered tuple of real
  numbers. The distinction is in how we use them and visualize them,
  although you should be prepared to play fast and loose with this
  distinction at times}
We can calculate the components by subtracting the coordinates of the
tail from the coordinates of the head. Two vectors are equivalent if
and only if their components are the same.


The main things we will do with vectors are (i) add two of them
together and (ii) multiply a vector by a real number (which is called
a \textbf{scalar} in this context). These are
defined componentwise: 
\begin{align*}
  \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle  +   \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle
  &= \langle u_1  + v_1, u_2 + v_2\rangle, \text{ and} \\
  c \langle u_1, u_2 \rangle
  &= \langle cu_1, cu_2 \rangle. 
\end{align*}
These definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication
lead to natural geometric interpretations, as shown in
Figures~\ref{fig:vectoradd} and \ref{fig:scalarmultiply}.

We typically assign names for vectors which are lowercase boldface
letters, like $\vec{u}$ or $\vec{v}$.  Looking at 
Figure~\ref{fig:scalarmultiply}, we make the following observation. 

\begin{obs}{Parallel vectors}{vecparallel} \bang{-5mm} Two vectors
  $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are parallel if $\vec{u} = c \, \vec{v}$ for
  some scalar $c$.
\end{obs}

Vector operations satisfy several properties suggested by the
notation,* such as commutativity
($\vec{u} + \vec{v} = \vec{v} + \vec{u}$), associativity
($(\vec{u} + \vec{v}) + \vec{w} = \vec{u} + (\vec{v} + \vec{w})$), the
distributive property of scalar multiplication across vector addition
(Exercise~\ref{exer:vector_distribution}) and so on. One simple strategy
for proving such property-verification exercises is to 
write out what each side of the equation means in terms of components and
then simplify both sides until it's clear that they are equal. \sidenote{*
  That is, we use the same notation as we use for
  multiplication/addition of real numbers because these operations
  satisfy many of the same properties}[-12mm]

\begin{exercise}{}{vector_distribution}
  Show that scalar multiplication distributes across vector
  addition. In other words, show that for all $c\in \R$ and vectors
  $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in $\R^n$, we have 
  \[
    c(\vec{u} + \vec{v})= c
    \vec{u} + c \vec{v}. 
  \] 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{vector_distribution_2}
  Show that scalar multiplication distributes across scalar 
  addition. In other words, show that for all $c\in \R$, $d \in \R$, and vectors
  $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ in $\R^n$, we have 
  \[
    (c+d)\vec{u}  = c \vec{u} + d \vec{u}. 
  \] 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{vector_subtraction}
  Choose two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ with small integer
  coordinates and draw a figure to show how $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{u}
  - \vec{v}$
  fit together to form a triangle. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Suppose that $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are vectors in $\R^2$ or
  $\R^3$, and suppose that $\mathbf{w} = c \mathbf{u} + d \mathbf{v}$,
  where $c$ and $d$ are both in $[0,1]$. If the tail of $\mathbf{w}$
  is at the origin, then what is the set of possible locations for the
  head of $\mathbf{w}$?
\end{exercise}

The following example shows how vector ideas can be applied to geometry
problems. 

\begin{example}{}{trianglemidpoint}
  Use vectors to prove that the line segment joining the midpoints of
  two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its
  length.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
  \begin{minipage}{12.5cm}
    Define $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ to be two vectors with a common
    tail at one vertex $O$ of the triangle and heads at the other two
    vertices $A$ and $B$ as shown. Then the vectors from $O$ to the
    midpoints of $OA$ and $OB$ are $\tfrac{1}{2}\vec{u}$ and
    $\tfrac{1}{2}\vec{v}$, since the midpoint of a line segment is
    defined to be the point which is halfway between the endpoints.

    Therefore, the vector $\vec{w}$ from one midpoint to another is
    $\tfrac{1}{2} \vec{v} - \tfrac{1}{2}\vec{u}$. By the
    distributive property, this is equal to
    $\tfrac{1}{2}(\vec{v} - \vec{u})$. The vector from $A$ to $B$
    is $\vec{v} - \vec{u}$.  Therefore, $\vec{w}$ has the same
    direction as the vector from $A$ to $B$ (by
    Observation~\ref{obs:vecparallel}) and is half as long.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Use vectors to show that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect one
  another. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  A median of a triangle is a line segment from a vertex of the
  triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. Use vectors to show
  that for any triangle, there is a point on all three medians. (Hint:
  This point will split each median into two segments, one of which is
  twice as long as the other.)
\end{exercise}

\section{The dot product} \label{sec:dot} 

\sidenote{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0}{\tbob}
  on the dot product}[-7.5mm]

The fundamental vector operations of scalar multiplication and vector
addition are not sufficient to capture information about a really important
geometric concept: \textit{angle}. So we introduce a new vector
operation.

\begin{defn}{Dot product}{dotproduct}
  The \textbf{dot product} of two three-dimensional vectors $\vec{u}
  = \langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle$
  and $\vec{v} =  \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle$ is defined by 
  \[
    \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = \langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle \cdot
    \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2+ u_3v_3.
  \]
\end{defn}

The dot product distributes across vector addition, and it is closely
related to length, as shown in the following exercise. We denote by
$|\vec{u}|$ the length of $\vec{u}$. 

\begin{exercise}{}{dotproduct}
  Verify that $\vec{u} \cdot (\vec{v} + \vec{w}) = \vec{u} \cdot
  \vec{v} + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{w}$ and that $\vec{u} \cdot
  \vec{u} = |\vec{u}|^2$.
\end{exercise}

Now we establish the relationship between the dot product and angle.
\enlargethispage{5mm} 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Use the law of cosines to show that $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} =
  |\vec{u}| |\vec{v}| \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle
  between $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
  \begin{minipage}{12.5cm}
    We apply the law of cosines to the triangle with sides
    $\vec{u}$, $\vec{v}$, and $\vec{u} - \vec{v}$. We get 
    \[
      |\vec{u} - \vec{v}|^2 =  |\vec{u}|^2 +  |\vec{v}|^2  -2|\vec{u}|
      |\vec{v}|\cos\theta
    \]
    The left-hand side works out to 
    \[
      |\vec{u} - \vec{v}|^2 = 
      (\vec{u} - \vec{v}) \cdot 
      (\vec{u} - \vec{v}) = 
      |\vec{u}|^2 + |\vec{v}|^2 - 2\, \vec{u} \cdot
      \vec{v}. 
    \]
    Subtracting these equations yields $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} =
    |\vec{u}| |\vec{v}| \cos\theta$. 
  \end{minipage} \quad 
  \begin{minipage}{3.2cm}
    \begin{asy}
      size(3cm);
      real ep = 0.2;
      draw((0,0)--(2,1)--(1,3)--cycle);
      draw((0,0)--(2,1),Arrow());
      draw((0,0)--(1,3),Arrow());
      draw((1,3)--(2,1),Arrow());
      label("$\theta$",(0.3,0.38));
      label("$\mathbf{u}$",(1,1/2),align=SE);
      label("$\mathbf{v}$",(1/2,3/2),align=WNW);
      label("$\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v}$",(3/2,2),align=ENE);
    \end{asy}
  \end{minipage}
\end{solution}

Particularly noteworthy is the case where $\theta$ is a right angle:
We say that two vectors are \textbf{perpendicular} or
\textbf{orthogonal} or  \textbf{normal} if they
meet at a right angle. 

\begin{obs}{Perpendicular vectors}{} \bang{-5mm}
  Two vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are perpendicular if and
  only if $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = 0$. 
\end{obs}

The following example shows how we can use the relation
$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = |\vec{u}| |\vec{v}| \cos\theta$ to find an
angle when information about coordinates is available. 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the angle between the diagonal of a cube and a diagonal of one
  of its faces.
  \begin{center}
    \begin{asy}[width=2cm]
      import three;
      currentlight.background = softblue; 
      defaultpen(linewidth(0.8));
      size(5cm);
      currentprojection=orthographic(4,2,1.2);
      draw(box((0,0,0),(1,1,1)));
      draw((0,0,0)--(1,1,0));
      draw((0,0,0)--(1,1,1));
    \end{asy}
  \end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
  The vector from the origin to the opposite corner of the cube is $\langle
  1,1,1\rangle$. The vector from the origin to the opposite corner of
  the bottom face is $\langle 1,1,0 \rangle$. Therefore, the angle is given by 
  \[
    \theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot
        \mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}|}\right) = \cos^{-1}\left(
      \frac{1 + 1 + 0}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}\sqrt{1^2+1^2+0^2}}
    \right) = \boxed{\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\right)}. 
  \]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Sketch the vectors $\mathbf{u} = \langle 4,2 \rangle$ and
  $\mathbf{v} = \langle -1, 2\rangle$ and show geometrically that they
  are perpendicular. 

  Then verify that the coordinate formula for dot product indeed gives 
  $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$ for these two vectors. 
\end{exercise}

We conclude this section by addressing the out-of-nowhere step where
we defined the formula for the dot product. We could have begun with
the geometric formula
$\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = |\vec{u}| |\vec{v}| \cos\theta$ as the
\textit{definition} of the dot product, derived the distributive
property of the dot product across vector addition using geometry, and
then obtained the formula for the dot product in the following 
way: define $\vec{i} = \langle1,0,0\rangle$,
$\vec{j} = \langle0,1,0\rangle$, and $\vec{k} =
\langle0,0,1\rangle$. Then a vector
$\vec{u} = \langle u_1, u_2, u_3\rangle$ can be written as
\[
  \vec{u} = u_1 \vec{i} + u_2 \vec{j} + u_3 \vec{k},
\]
and similarly for $\vec{v}$. Then 
\begin{align*}
  \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} &= (u_1 \vec{i} + u_2 \vec{j} + u_3
                          \vec{k})(v_1 \vec{i} + v_2 \vec{j} + v_3 \vec{k})  \\
                        &= u_1 v_1 \vec{i} \cdot \vec{i} + u_1 v_2 \vec{i} \cdot
                          \vec{j}  + u_1 v_3 \vec{i} \cdot \vec{k}  + \\ 
                        &\hspace{5mm}  u_2 v_1 \vec{j} \cdot \vec{i} + u_2 v_2 \vec{j} \cdot
                          \vec{j}  + u_2 v_3 \vec{j} \cdot \vec{k}  + \\ 
                        &\hspace{5mm}  u_3 v_1 \vec{k} \cdot \vec{i} + u_3 v_2 \vec{k} \cdot
                          \vec{j}  + u_3 v_3 \vec{k} \cdot \vec{k},
\end{align*}
by the distributive property. This looks like a mess, but since
$\vec{i}$,  $\vec{j}$, and  $\vec{k}$ are 
perpendicular, six of these nine terms are zero. Furthermore, since
$\vec{i}\cdot \vec{i} = 1$ and similarly for $\vec{j}$ and
$\vec{k}$, we end up with $  \vec{u} \cdot \vec{v}  = u_1 v_1
+ u_2 v_2 + u_3 v_3$, as desired.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Show that the vectors
  $\mathbf{u} = \langle \cos \theta, \sin \theta \rangle$ and
  $\mathbf{v} = \langle -\sin \theta, \cos \theta \rangle$ are unit
  vectors (meaning that the length of each is 1). Show that $\vec{u}$
  and $\vec{v}$ are orthogonal.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{Orthogonal Projection}{proj}
  Suppose vectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are given with
  $|\mathbf{u}| = 1$. If $\vec{v} = \vec{v}_1 + \vec{v_2}$, where
  $\vec{v}_1$ and $\vec{v}_2$ are perpendicular and $\vec{v}_1$ is
  parallel to $\vec{u}$, then $\vec{v}_1$ is called the
  \textit{orthogonal projection} of $\vec{v}$ onto $\vec{u}$. The
  magnitude of $\mathbf{v}_1$ is called the \textit{component} of
  $\mathbf{v}$ in the $\mathbf{u}$ direction.

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Draw a figure illustrating the relationship between $\vec{u}$,
    $\vec{v}$, $\vec{v}_1$, and $\vec{v}_2$. 

  \item Use right-triangle trigonometry to find a formula for the
    length of $\mathbf{v}_1$ in terms of the angle $\theta$ between
    $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$, and then use dot products to find a
    formula for $\vec{v}_1$ in terms of $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$.

  \item Use your findings to support the statement \textit{dotting
      with a unit vector $\mathbf{u}$ gives the component in the
      $\mathbf{u}$ direction}. 
  \end{enumerate}

information about \textit{angle}; in this section we'll see a new
vector product which gives us information about \textit{area}.

  \caption{The cross product of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, whose

\end{wrapfigure}

The \textbf{cross product} of $\mathbf{u} = (u_1,u_2,u_3)$ and
$\mathbf{v} = (v_1,v_2,v_3)$ is defined by expanding the following
`determinant' by minors along the first row:* \sidenote{* We put
  \textit{determinant} in scare quotes because the matrix entries are
  not numbers}
\sidenote{\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0}{\tbob} A
  beautiful explanation of this formula}[20mm]
\[
  \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = 
  \left|
    \begin{array}{ccc}
      \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
      u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
      v_1 & v_2 & v_3
    \end{array}
  \right| =
  (u_2v_3 - u_3 v_2) \mathbf{i}
  - (u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) \mathbf{j}
  + (u_1v_2 - u_2 v_1) \mathbf{k}. 
\]

Note that the dot product of two vectors is a scalar, while the cross
product of two vectors is another vector. It turns out that this
vector is orthogonal to \textit{both} of the first two. 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Confirm that $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to
  $\mathbf{u}$ and to $\mathbf{v}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We compute $\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{u} \times \vec{v})$ as
  follows: 
  \begin{align*}
    \langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle \cdot \langle u_2v_3 - u_3 v_2, 
    - (u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1), 
    u_1v_2 - u_2 v_1 \rangle&= \\
    ( u_2v_3 - u_3 v_2)u_1 &- (u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) u_2 +
                             ( u_1v_2 - u_2 v_1) u_3   = 0. 
  \end{align*}
  This implies that $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to
  $\mathbf{u}$. Swapping out $\mathbf{u}$ for $\mathbf{v}$, we see
  that $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$ is orthogonal to
  $\mathbf{v}$ too.

  Alternatively, we could note that
  \[
    \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{u} \times \vec{v}) =
    \left|
      \begin{array}{ccc}
        u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\        u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
        v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\
      \end{array}
    \right|
  \]
  and conclude using Exercise~\ref{exer:singular} that this
  determinant equals zero.

The following exercise provides the advertised connection to
area. Recall from geometry that the area of a parallelogram with sides
of length $a$ and $b$ meeting at an angle $\theta$ is equal to $ab\sin
\theta$.*

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Verify that $|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}|^2 =
  |\mathbf{u}|^2|\mathbf{v}|^2 - (\mathbf{u}\cdot \mathbf{v})^2$. Use this fact to
  show that 
  \[
    |\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}| = |\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}|\sin\theta,
  \]
  where $\theta$ is the angle between $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$. 
\end{exercise}

So to sum up: $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$ is a vector which is
orthogonal to both $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ and whose length is
equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by $\mathbf{u}$ and
$\mathbf{v}$. Note that there are only two vectors satisfying both of
these conditions. To determine which one is
$\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$, we use the \textit{right-hand rule}:
imagine orienting your right hand so that you can curl your fingers
from $\mathbf{u}$ towards $\mathbf{v}$. The direction of your thumb
(if it's orthogonal to your fingers) is the direction of
$\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$.

\section{Lines and planes} \label{sec:lines_and_planes} 

There are various ways to describe a line in 2D space using an
equation, including point-slope form and $y$-intercept form. In this
section we will learn the 3D analogue: equation descriptions of lines
and planes in space. We begin with an example.

\begin{example}{}{line}
  Describe the line $L$ in $\R^3$ passing through the points
  $A = (3,-4,1)$ and $B = (2,-1,4)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can tell whether a given point $(x,y,z)$ in $\R^3$ is on the line
  $L$ using vectors: $(x,y,z)$ is on $L$ if and only if the vector
  from $(3,-4,1)$ to $(x,y,z)$ is a scalar multiple of the vector from
  $(3,-4,1)$ to $(2,-1,4)$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:linecheck}). We can
  turn this into an equation: a point $(x,y,z)$ is on $L$ if and only
  if there exists $t\in \R$ such that
  \[
    t \big\langle 2-3, -1-(-4), 4-1\big\rangle = \big\langle x - 3, y -(-4), z -
    1\big\rangle. 
  \]
  Setting components equal, we find that $(x,y,z)$ is on $L$ if and
  only if there exists $t$ so that 
  \begin{align} \nonumber 
    x &= 3 - t, \\ \label{eq:par}
    y &= -4 + 3t, \text{ and} \\  \nonumber 
    z &= 1 + 3t.
  \end{align}
\end{solution}

\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{O}{6cm}

    import tube;

    draw(u + -1*(v-u)--v + (v-u),Arrows3());
    draw(u--z,linewidth(1.2),Arrow3(10));
    draw(u--v,linewidth(1.2),Arrow3(10));
    
    label("$(x,y,z)$",z,align=E); 
    label("$A$",u,align=NW);
    label("$B$",v,align=NW);
  \end{asy}
  \caption{Checking whether $(x,y,z)$ is on the line through $A$ and
    $B$ \label{fig:linecheck}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that the solution above involves a new variable $t$; this is
called a \textit{parameter}, and the form we gave as an answer is
called \textbf{parametric form}. You can imagine drawing the line by
starting with $t = 0$, so that your pen begins at $A$, and then
sweeping $t$ through the values from 0 to 1, changing the location
of your pen according to the parametric equations \eqref{eq:par}. Your
pen will sweep out the line segment from $A$ and $B$. Then you can
let $t$ vary beyond 1 to get the rest of the ray past $B$, and you can
let $t$ vary over the negative numbers to get the part of the line on
the other side of $A$.

If we didn't want to involve $t$, note that we could solve for $t$ in
one equation and substitute into the other two, thereby obtaining
\textit{two} equations involving $x$, $y$, and $z$. This makes sense:
starting from the plane, imposing one equation on $x$ and $y$ cuts the
dimension down by one and gives a line. However, starting from 3D
space, we need to reduce the dimension by \textit{two}. So we need
two equations.

The procedure developed in Example~\ref{exam:line} works in general:
the line through $A = (a,b,c)$ and $B$ has parametric form*
\sidenote{* Note that this representation is not unique, since we
  could've used $B$ (or any other point on the line) in place of $A$}
\begin{align*}
  x &= a + v_1 t, \\
  y &= b + v_2 t \\ 
  z &= c + v_3 t, 
\end{align*}
where $\langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle = \overrightarrow{AB}$ is the
vector from $A$ to $B$.

\begin{example}{}{planeequation}
  Describe the plane $P$ passing through the points $A = (1,0,0)$, $B =
  (0,1,1)$, and $C = (0,0,2)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can tell whether $(x,y,z)$ is on $P$ using vectors. Define
  $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ to be the vectors from $A$ to $B$ and
  from $A$ to $C$, respectively. 
  \begin{center}

      triple A = (1,0,0);
      triple B = (0,1,1);

      draw("$\mathbf{n}$",A--A+cross(B-A,C-A),Arrow3(),align=SW);
      real eps = 0.1;
      
      draw(A + eps*cross(B-A,C-A) --
      A + eps*cross(B-A,C-A) + eps*(A-C) --
      A + eps*(A-C));
      
      draw(A--D,Arrow3());
      dot("$(x,y,z)$", D,align=NW);

      draw("$\mathbf{u}$",A--B,Arrow3(),align=SE);
      draw("$\mathbf{v}$",A--C,Arrow3(),align=W);
    \end{asy}
  \end{center}
  If we can find a vector $\mathbf{n}$ which is orthogonal to $P$,
  then we can say $(x,y,z)$ is on $P$ if and only if the vector from
  $A$ to $(x,y,z)$ is orthogonal to $\mathbf{n}$. But we can take
  $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$, since the cross product
  of two vectors is orthogonal to both of them. So
  \[
    \mathbf{n} = \langle -1,1, 1\rangle \times \langle -1, 0, 2 \rangle =
    \langle 2,1,1 \rangle. 
  \]
  Now we can say that $(x,y,z)$ is on $P$ if and only if* \sidenote{*
    Note that we
    could use $B$ or $C$ instead $A = (1,0,0)$ here and we'd get the same
    equation for the plane}
  \[
    \mathbf{n} \cdot \langle x - 1 , y - 0 , z - 0 \rangle = 0, 
  \]
  which simplifies to $\boxed{2x + y + z = 2}$. 
\end{solution}

\begin{obs}{Vector normal to a plane}{} \bang{-3mm}
  A vector $\mathbf{n}$ normal to the plane $ax +by + cz = d$
  can be read off from the coefficients:
  \[
    \mathbf{n} = \langle a,b,c \rangle. 
  \]
\end{obs}

One important 3D geometry problem is to find distances between points,
lines, and planes.* We define the distance between two sets to be the
\textit{minimum} distance between any pair of points from the
respective sets. \sidenote{* We can ask about the distance from a point to a
  point, a point to a line, a point to a plane, a line to a line, a
  line to a plane, or a plane to a plane}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Consider the line $\ell$ given by the parametric equation
  $(x,y,z) = (1-2t,3,t)$. Find the distance from $\ell$ to the line
  $m$ which is parallel to $\ell$ and which passes through the point
  $(9,4,1)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.65\textwidth}
    The parametric equations give us convenient access to
    a point on each of the two lines as well as a vector $\mathbf{v}$
    which is parallel to both lines. So we make a figure with this
    information.
    
    If we define $\mathbf{u}$ to be the vector from connecting the two
    given points, we can see by applying right-triangle trigonometry to
    the figure that the desired distance $d$ is equal to
    $|\mathbf{u}| \sin \theta$. Therefore,
    \[
      d = \frac{|\mathbf{u}||\mathbf{v}|\sin \theta}{|\mathbf{v}|} =
      \frac{|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{v}|} =
      \frac{\sqrt{105}}{\sqrt{5}} = \boxed{\sqrt{21}}\,.
    \]
  \end{minipage} \: 
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.32\textwidth}

      defaultpen(fontsize(8)); 
      
      real f(real x){
        return x*x;
      }
      
      pair A = (0,0);
      pair B = (2,1);
      pair C = (-1,1);
      
      draw(A--B,Arrows());
      draw(A+C--B+C,Arrows());
      
      dot("$(1,3,0)$",A + 0.2*(B-A),align=2*SSE);
      dot("$(9,4,1)$",C + 0.8*(B-A),align=1.2*WNW);

      \theta$",(1.13,1.41),align=SW);
    \end{asy}
  \end{minipage}
\end{solution}

Note the basic strategy: (i) draw a figure containing the information
that the problem gives us (a schematic diagram suffices; there is no
need to make it particularly precise), (ii) use right triangle
trigonometry to express the desired distance terms of vectors we have,
and (iii) use vector formulas to calculate the desired quantity using
a dot or cross product.

A second important operation is finding points of intersection. 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the point where the line $\langle 3 + t, -2t , 3 \rangle$
  intersects the plane $x + y + z = 7$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  A point is on the intersection of two graphs if and only if it's on
  both graphs. Therefore, we're looking for a point $(x,y,z)$ that
  satisfies $x + y + z = 7$ and has the property that there exists
  $t\in \R$ such that $x = 3 + t, y = -2t,$ and $z=3$. Thus we have
  four equations and four unknowns ($x,y,z,t$), and we can substitute
  the last three equations into the first to find that $6-t = 7$,
  which implies $t = -1$. Therefore, the point of intersection is
  $(2,2,3)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Find the equation of the plane passing through the points $(1,0,0)$,
  $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. Find the distance from that plane to the
  origin. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Find the distance between the planes $x+y-2z = 3$ and $x+y-2z = 0$. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Find the distance between the lines $(x,y,z) = (2t, 1-t, 4)$ and
  $(x,y,z) = (1 + t, -2t, -1-t)$. Hint: these lines are \textit{skew},
  meaning that they are not parallel but do not intersect. Begin by
  using a cross product to find a vector which is perpendicular to
  both lines. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Describe parametrically the intersection of the planes $2x + z = 3$
  and $x + y - 2z = 4$.

\section{Vector-valued functions} \label{sec:motion_in_space}

\subsection{Paths in space}

Consider a particle moving along the number line in such a way that
its position at time $t$ is given by $r(t)$. Then the velocity of the
particle at time $t$ is given by the first derivative $v(t) =
r'(t)$. The velocity specifies the \textit{speed} of the particle as well as
its \textit{direction} (left if negative, right if positive).

The same is true of a particle moving in 2D or 3D space: its location
is specified by a function customarily denoted $\mathbf{r}(t)$ from
$\R$ to either $\R^2$ or $\R^3$, and its derivative*
$\mathbf{v}(t) = \mathbf{r}'(t)$ at time $t$ tells us the speed of the
particle at that time (via its length) as well as the direction. We
call $\mathbf{r}$ a \textit{path}*. \sidenote{* The derivative of a
  path $\mathbf{r}$ is the vector obtained by taking the derivative of
  each component}[-3cm] \sidenote{* For a function from $\R^1$ to
  $\R^2$ or $\R^3$ to count as a path, we require that each of its
  components be continuous. For example, $\mathbf{r}(t) = (\e^t, t^2 \sin
  t)$ is a path}


\begin{example}[breakable]{}{can}
  Consider a bug which crawls counterclockwise around a cylinder of
  radius 1 meter from
  $(1,0,0)$ to $(1,0,1)$ as shown: 
  \begin{center}
    \begin{asy}
      import graph3; 
      size(4cm);
      
      currentprojection=perspective(5.7,3.1,1.26); 
      currentlight.background = softblue;
      
      draw(O--1.4*X,Arrow3());
      draw(O--1.4*Y,Arrow3());
      draw(O--1.2*Z,Arrow3());
      
      triple f(real t){
        return (cos(2*pi*t), sin(2*pi*t), t);
      }

      path3 g = graph(f,0,1);
      
      draw(unitcylinder, surfacepen = material(diffusepen=0.4*LightSeaGreen+0.6*black,
      emissivepen=0.4*LightSeaGreen+0.6*black)); 
      draw(g,DarkRed+linewidth(1.5)); 

      real t = 0.1;
      draw(f(t) -- f(t) + 0.10 * (-2*pi*sin(2*pi*t), (2*pi)*cos(2*pi*t), 1),DarkBlue+linewidth(1.2),Arrow3(5));
      label("$\mathbf{v}(t)$", f(t+0.065) + 0.2*(cos(0.1),sin(0.1),1) + 0.00 * Z,DarkBlue); 
      dot(f(0.11),DarkBlue); 
      label("$\mathbf{r}(t)$",(0,1.3,0.4),DarkRed); 
    \end{asy}
  \end{center}
  Assuming the bug moves at constant speed and makes the whole journey
  in one second, find a formula for the position and velocity of the
  bug at time $t$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can see that the $z$-coordinate of the bug's position increases
  at a constant rate from 0 to 1 as $t$ goes from 0 to 1, so the
  $z$-coordinate of $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is $t$.

  For the $x$ and $y$ coordinates, we need a pair of functions
  $(x(t),y(t))$ that traces out the unit circle in one second. Recall
  that cosine and sine are defined to be the functions that trace out
  the unit circle according to angle, so we can scale them so they
  make it around in 1 second instead of $2\pi$ seconds:
  \[
    (x(t),y(t)) = \left( \cos 2\pi t, \sin 2\pi t
    \right). 
  \]
  So all together we have
  \[
    \boxed{\mathbf{r}(t) =  \left\langle \cos 2\pi t, \sin 2\pi t
        , t \right\rangle}\,, 
  \]
  which means that
  \[
    \boxed{\mathbf{v}(t) = \left\langle -2\pi \sin 2\pi t, 2\pi\cos 2\pi t
        , 1 \right\rangle}\,.
  \]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Find the times $t \geq 0$ when a particle whose location at time $t$
  is $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t^3 - t^2, t\rangle$ is at its slowest.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  The acceleration $\mathbf{a}(t)$ of a particle whose position at
  time $t$ is given by $\mathbf{r}(t)$ is defined to be
  $\mathbf{v}'(t) = \mathbf{r}''(t)$.  Suppose that the acceleration
  $\mathbf{a}(t)$ of a particle is given by
  $\mathbf{a}(t) = \langle 2t, t^2 \rangle$. If
  $\mathbf{r}(0) = \mathbf{0}$ and
  $\mathbf{v}(0) = \langle 1, 2 \rangle$, then find a formula for
  $\mathbf{r}(t)$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  An astronaut is using a rope to move in space in such a way that his
  position at time $t$ is given by 
  $\mathbf{r}(t) = (2+t) \mathbf{i} + (2+\ln t) \mathbf{j} + \left( 7
    - \frac{4}{t^2+1}\right) \mathbf{k}$. The coordinates of the space
  station doorway are $(5,4,9)$. When should the astronaut let go of the
  rope so as to drift into the doorway?

called a parametric equation for the curve. \enlargethispage{1cm}

    The main idea is to reduce the 3D problem to a 2D problem by finding
    a shadow of the curve that we can parameterize. Looking at the
    figure, it appears that the shadow of this curve in the $xz$
    plane is an ellipse. If we substitute $y = 1-z$ into
    $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$, we see that every point on the curve indeed
    satisfies* $x^2 + 2z^2 - 2z = 0$. \sidenote{* This equation
      describes an elliptical \textit{cylinder}, because it is the set of all

  The intersection of this surface with the $xz$-plane is an ellipse

  \[
    \left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos t, 0, \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\sin t\right),
  \]
  where $t$ ranges over $[0,2\pi]$. Using the equation $y = 1- z$, we
  see that the point on the curve whose shadow is
  $\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos t, 0, \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\sin t\right)$
  is
  $\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\cos t, \tfrac{1}{2} - \tfrac{1}{2} \sin t,
    \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2}\sin t\right)$. As $t$ ranges
  from $0$ to $2\pi$, this point goes all the way around the cylinder,
  so this formula indeed parameterizes the curve.

\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Consider a wheel of unit radius centered at $(0,1)$ in a coordinate
  plane. At time $t=0$, the wheel begins rolling (without slipping)
  along the $x$-axis to the right at a rate of one unit per

      }
    \end{asy}
  \end{center}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Because the wheel is moving at a unit rate of speed, the location of
  its center at time $t$ is $(t,1)$. After $t$ seconds, the wheel has
  rotated $t$ units along its perimeter, which corresponds to rotating
  $t$ radians. Therefore, the angle of the point on the wheel
  originally at the origin starts at $\tfrac{3\pi}{2}$ and advances in
  the clockwise direction at a rate of one radian per second. Thus the
  vector from the wheel's center to the desired point is
  $\langle \cos\left(\tfrac{3\pi}{2}-t\right),
  \sin\left(\tfrac{3\pi}{2}-t\right)\rangle$, which simplifies to
  $\langle -\sin t, - \cos t \rangle$. So the location of the
  desired point is the sum of the point $(t,1)$ and the vector
  $\langle -\sin t, - \cos t \rangle$:
  \[
    \boxed{\mathbf{r}(t) = (t - \sin t, 1- \cos t)}\,.

\begin{solution}

    Since the speed of the bug is constant and the whole journey takes a
    second, the speed in meters per second is equal to the length of the
    bug's path divided by 1 second.

    Consider any time $t \in [0,1)$ and a very small time $\Delta
    t$. Over the interval $[t,t+\Delta t]$, the bug's speed is
    approximately $|\mathbf{v}(t)|$, so the distance it moves is
    approximately equal to $|\mathbf{v}(t)|\Delta t$. Fixing a large
    integer $n$ and splitting up the interval $[0,1]$ into $n$ intervals
    of width $\Delta t = 1/n$, total distance is approximately

  This expression is a Riemann sum approximating the integral

      2\pi t + 4\pi^2 \cos^2 2 \pi t + 1} \, \d t =
    \boxed{\sqrt{4\pi^2 + 1}}. 
  \]
  Although we arrived at this answer using approximations that we
  weren't so careful about, this is indeed the same result we
  would've gotten if we'd cut a slit in the cylinder and unrolled it
  to find that the bug's path is equal in length to the hypotenuse of
  a rectangle with side lengths 1 (the height of the cylinder) and
  $2\pi$ (the circumference of the cylinder).
\end{solution}

The method developed in Example~\ref{exam:bugspeed} leads to the
following definition. A function from an interval to $\R$ is
\textbf{piecewise differentiable} if its domain can be subdivided into
finitely many intervals such that the function is differentiable on
each of them. A function from an interval to $\R^n$ is defined to be
piecewise differentiable if all of its components are.

\begin{defn}{Arclength}{arclength} 
  The \textbf{arclength} of a piecewise differentiable path
  $\mathbf{r}:[a,b] \to \R^n$ is defined to be
  \[
    \int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t, 
  \]
  assuming this integral exists.
\end{defn}

One important property of this definition is that it should not depend
on the rate at which the curve is traced out.* In other words, suppose
person A draws a curve with a consistent pace, while person B rushes
through the first part of the curve and slows down towards the end. As
long as the curves they draw are the same, the lengths should be the
same. Let's try an example.* \sidenote{* A property of a path which
  depends only on the curve it traces out is called
  \textbf{parameterization independent}}[-3cm] \sidenote{* See
  Appendix~\ref{sec:arclengthappendix} for an explanation of why this
  is true in general}

\begin{example}{Parameterization independence}{}
  Use the arclength formula to find the length of the portion of the
  unit circle in the first quadrant in two ways: using $\mathbf{r}_1(t)
  = (\cos t, \sin t)$, and using $\mathbf{r}_2(t) = (t,\sqrt{1-t^2})$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  For $\mathbf{r}_1$, we have 
  \[
    \int_0^{\pi/2} \sqrt{(-\sin t)^2 + (\cos t)^2} \, \d t = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}, 
  \]
  and for $\mathbf{r}_2$, we have
  \[
    \int_0^1 \sqrt{1^2 + \left(\frac{-2t}{2\sqrt{1-t^2}}\right)^2}\, \d
    t =  \int_0^1 \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2}} \, \d t = \arcsin(1) -
    \arcsin(0) = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{2}}, 
  \]
  where we performed the last integral by recalling that the
  derivative of the inverse sine function is
  $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-t^2}}$. 
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Sketch the path
  $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle \e^{-t} \cos t, \e^{-t} \sin t \rangle$. Show
  that the length of this path over the interval $[0,a]$ converges as

  the interval $[0,\infty)$?

\subsection{Curvature*} 

The curvature of a path at a point on the path is a measure of how
curvy the path is at that point. For example, the path shaped like the
letter ``\textsf{U}'' has a small curvature (zero, in fact) near its
endpoints and a larger curvature at points along the bend.

One natural way to distinguish points on a path where the path has
large curvature from points where the path's curvature is small is to
ascertain \textit{how rapidly the direction of the velocity vector
  changes, per unit of arclength}. This leads to the following
definition.

\begin{defn}[breakable]{Curvature}{curvature}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i),leftmargin=12pt,topsep=-6pt,itemsep=4pt]
  \item The \textbf{unit tangent vector} of a differentiable path $\mathbf{r}:[a,b]
    \to \R^n$ is defined to be
    \[
      \mathbf{T}(t) = \frac{\mathbf{r}'(t)}{|\mathbf{r}'(t)|}. 
    \]
  \item The \textbf{arclength function} $s(t)$ is defined to be the length
    of $\mathbf{r}$ over the interval $[a,t]$.
  \item The \textbf{curvature} $\kappa(t)$ of $\mathbf{r}$ at time $t$ is
    defined by
    \[
      \mathbf{\kappa}(t) = \frac{|\d\mathbf{T}/\d t|}{\d s/\d t}. 
    \]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the curvature of a circle of radius $a$ using
  Definition~\ref{defn:curvature}. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We parameterize the circle as $(a \cos t, a \sin t)$ where $t$
  ranges over $[0,2\pi]$, and we determine that
  \[
    \mathbf{T} = \frac{\langle -a \sin t, a \cos t\rangle }{|\langle
      -a \sin t, a \cos t\rangle|} = \langle -\sin t, \cos t \rangle. 
  \]
  The arclength function is* $s(t) = \displaystyle{\int_0^t |\langle -a \sin t, a \cos
    t\rangle| \, \d\tau} = at$. \sidenote{* We'll use $\tau$ as the
    variable of integration, since we're already using $t$ as a limit
    of integration}

  Therefore, the curvature is $\displaystyle{\kappa(t) = \frac{|\langle -\cos t, -\sin t
      \rangle|}{|\d(at)/\d t|} = \boxed{\frac{1}{a}}}$.

  This formula makes sense, because a very large circle looks quite flat
  (consider standing on the equator as opposed to standing on a
  latitude line a few feet from the North Pole).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Suppose that $\mathbf{r}$ is a differentiable path and that
  $\mathbf{T}$ is its unit tangent vector. Use the fact that the
  length of $\mathbf{T}(t)$ is constant to show that $\mathbf{T}(t)$ is
  always orthogonal to $\mathbf{T}'(t)$.

\section{Quadric surfaces} \label{sec:quadric_surfaces} 

The \textit{graph} of an equation involving the variables $x,y,z$ is
the set of points $(x,y,z)$ in $\R^3$ which satisfy the equation. For
example, we have seen that the graph of $x + y + z = 1$ is a plane in
$\R^3$. More generally, the graph of any linear equation in $\R^3$ is
a plane. So let's step it up a notch and consider \textit{quadratic}
equations.* \sidenote{* The 2D analogues are \textit{conic sections}:
  parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. These are graphs of various
  quadratic equations in two variables} A graph of a quadratic
equation in the variables $x,y,z$ is called a \textit{quadric
  surface}. 

Perhaps the simplest quadratic equation to reason about is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 =
1$. The left-hand side has a geometric interpretation as \textit{the
  squared distance from $(x,y,z)$ to the origin}. Therefore, a point $(x,y,z)$
satisfies this equation if and only if its squared distance to the
origin is 1. We have a name for the set of such points: the
\textit{sphere} of radius 1, centered at the origin.

The situation is not always so simple. So here's a key idea for
tackling 3D geometry problems: \textbf{slice it up}. Consider planes
of the form $z = \mathrm{constant}$, $y = \mathrm{constant}$, or
$z = \mathrm{constant}$ and see what your graph looks like in these
planes. Here's an archetypal example.

\begin{example}{}{}
  Figure out what the graph of $x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 1$ looks like. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth} 
    We begin by finding all the points which satisfy this equation and
    the equation $z = 0$. If $(x,y,z)$ satisfies this equation and $z
    =0$, then that means that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Furthermore, if  $x^2 +
    y^2 = 1$ and $z = 0$, then $(x,y,z)$ satisfies the equation $x^2 +
    y^2 - z^2 = 1$. This means that the intersection of the desired
    graph and the line $z = 0$ is the circle of radius 1 centered at the
    origin.
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.29\textwidth}
    \begin{asy} 
      import graph3;
      currentlight.background = softyellow; 
      size(4cm);
      
      draw(O--4*X,Arrow3(4));
      draw(O--4*Y,Arrow3(4));
      draw(O--2.5*Z,Arrow3(4));
      
      for(real z=-2; z<= 2; z += 0.2){
        draw(circle(c=(0,0,z),r=sqrt(1+z^2),normal=Z));
      }
    \end{asy}
  \end{minipage}

  Similarly, the intersection of the desired graph and the plane
  $z = 1$ is a circle which is centered at $(0,0,1)$ and has radius
  $\sqrt{2}$. Drawing in several more of these traces*, we get a
  picture that looks like the figure above. \sidenote{* A \textit{trace} of a figure
    is an intersection of that figure with a plane}
  This is already a pretty clear picture of what the graph looks like:
  it's rotationally symmetric about the $z$-axis and ``flares out'' as
  you move away from the $xy$-plane. This graph is called a
  \textit{one-sheeted hyperboloid}. 
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}

\section{Polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates} \label{sec:coordinates} 

A coordinate system is a way of identifying locations using pairs or
triples of real numbers. Rectangular coordinates---the ones commonly
denoted $(x,y)$ or $(x,y,z)$---have some nice properties, but
some tasks are much more convenient in other coordinate systems.

For example, a captain at sea wishing to communicate the location of a
nearby pirate ship would probably describe its location in terms of
the distance $r$ between the two ships and an angle $\theta$ (which
might be given with reference to the ship's orientation or as a
cardinal direction). The captain is using \textit{polar coordinates}. 

Given a point in the plane, we define $r$ to be its distance from the
origin and $\theta$ to be the signed angle formed between the positive
horizontal axis and the vector from the origin to the point. The word
\textit{signed} means that an angle measured clockwise from the
positive $x$-axis counts as negative. The values $r$ and $\theta$ are
called the radial and angular polar coordinates of the point,
respectively.* \sidenote{* So a coordinate is a function from a set of
  points to $\R$}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Show that if the polar coordinates of a point $(x,y)$ are $r$ and
  $\theta$, then we have
  \[
    x = r\cos \theta, \quad \text { and } \quad y  = r\sin \theta. 
  \]
\end{exercise}

Correspondingly, we can coordinatize three-dimensional space by
replacing either one or two spatial coordinates with an angular
coordinate. Perhaps the simplest way to do this is leave $z$ the same
and replace $(x,y)$ with polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$. In other
words, we define*\sidenote{* Try coming up with geometric descriptions
  of the coordinates $r$, $\theta$, and $z$ in 3D space
  \textit{before} looking at the answer below}[-13mm] for each point
$P$ in $\R^3$:
\begin{align*}
  r(P) &= \text{distance from $P$ to the }z\text{-axis} \\
  \theta(P) &= \text{signed angle* of the $P$-containing half-plane
              whose boundary is along the $z$-axis} \\ 
  z(P) &= \text{signed distance from $P$ to the }xy\text{-plane}. 
\end{align*} \sidenote{* $\ldots$measured counterclockwise with respect to the
  positive $x$-axis}[-1cm]Then we can describe a point by its
\textbf{cylindrical coordinates} $(r,\theta, z)$ rather than its
rectangular coordinates. We may also describe a solid in $\R^3$
by giving inequalities in the variables $r, \theta,$ and $z$ such that
a point with cylindrical coordinates
$(r,\theta,z)$
satisfies the inequalities if and only if the point is in the given solid. 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Graph* the system of cylindrical coordinate inequalities $r \leq 4$,
  \quad $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/3$, \quad $0 \leq z \leq 2$. Find the
  volume of the resulting region. \sidenote{* Familiarity with

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Graph the system of inequalities $0 \leq r \leq z$, \: $\pi \leq \theta
  \leq 2\pi$. 
\end{exercise}

Cylindrical coordinates have two distance coordinates and one angular
coordinate. How can we specify a point in space using one distance
coordinate and two angular coordinates? The most natural candidate for
the distance coordinate is the distance from the origin. In other
words, we define $\rho(x,y,z) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$. We call this
coordinate $\rho$ instead of $r$ to distinguish it from the radial
polar coordinate.

As for the angular coordinates, let's use the cylindrical coordinate
$\theta$ for one of them. For the other, we measure the angle $\phi$
between the positive $z$-axis and the vector from the origin to
$(x,y,z)$. This pair of angular coordinates might be familiar: we use
them to describe locations on the surface of the earth. In that
context, the angle $\theta$ is called longitude and the angle $\phi$
is called latitude.

Note that $\theta$ varies from 0 to $2\pi$ as one loops around the
$z$-axis. However, the angle $\phi$ varies only from 0 to $\pi$ as one
goes from the north pole to the south pole. Thus the angles $\theta$
and $\phi$ do not play symmetric roles.* \sidenote{* This is because
  $\phi$ measures the angle required to rotate a vector
  \textit{freely} so as to align with the positive $z$-axis, while
  $-\theta$ measures the signed angle needed to rotate the vector
  \textit{about the $z$-axis} to get to the positive half of the
  $xz$-plane}[-2cm]

\begin{example}{}{spherical}
  Graph the system of inequalities $\tfrac{1}{2} \leq \rho \leq 1$, \: $0

    sphere of radius $\tfrac{1}{2}$ centered at the origin.  Then the

\chapter{Multivariable Differentiation}

In this chapter, we will be considering functions from $\R^n$ to
$\R^1$, where $n \geq 2$. The main objectives will be to extend
various important notions in single-variable calculus to the
higher-dimensional setting.

\section{Limits} \label{sec:limits}

Limits are useful for discussing a function's output values
\textit{near}---but not \textit{at}---a point in its domain. For
example, if $f:\R \to \R$ maps 0 to 3 and every nonzero number to 7,
then we would say that the limit of $f(x)$ as $x\to 0$ is equal to 7. 

We begin with the notion of a limit at 0 for a \textit{monotone}
function from* \sidenote{* The right endpoint of the interval $(0,1)$
  is immaterial here, since we will be interested in the limit at 0}[3mm]
$(0,1)$ to $\R$. We say that $a$ is a \textbf{lower bound} for a
function $f$ if its range is a subset of $[a,\infty)$. A function is
\textbf{bounded below} if it has a lower bound. Likewise, $b$ is an
\textbf{upper bound} of $f$ if the range of $f$ is a subset of $(-\infty,b]$,
and a function is \textbf{bounded above} if it has an upper
bound.* \sidenote{* For example, $f(x) = x$ is neither
bounded above nor below, while $g(x) = e^x$ is bounded below but not
above, and $h(x) = \sin x$ is bounded above and below (where $f$, $g$,
and $h$ are from $\R$ to $\R$)}[16mm]

\begin{defn}{Limit of a monotone function on $(0,1)$}{limmon} \parskip = 6 pt 
  Suppose that $f:(0,1) \to \R$ is bounded below and has the property
  that $f(r)$ decreases as $r$ decreases --- in other words,
  we have $f(r) \leq f(s)$ for all $0 \leq r \leq s \leq 1$. Then we define
  $L$ to be the greatest real number such that $L \leq f(r)$ for all
  $r\in (0,1)$. 

  Similarly, if $f$ is bounded above and has the property that $f(r)$
  increases as $r$ decreases, then we define $L$ to be the least real
  number such that $L \geq f(r)$ for all $r \in (0,1)$.

  In either case, we say that the limit as $r\to0$ of $f(r)$ exists
  and is equal to $L$, that is,
  $\displaystyle{\lim_{r\to 0} f(r) = L}$.
\end{defn}

    on $(0,1)$.

\begin{solution}
  (a) Since $f(r)$ decreases as $r$ decreases and $f$ is bounded below,
  Definition~\ref{defn:limmon} says that the desired limit exists and
  is equal to the greatest lower bound of the range of $f$. Since the
  range of $f$ is the interval $(1,2)$, we see that the greatest lower
  bound is $\boxed{1}$.

  (b) Similarly, since $g(r)$ increases as $r$ decreases and is
  bounded above, Definition~\ref{defn:limmon} says that the desired
  limit exists and is equal to the least upper bound of the range of
  $f$. We can see from the geometric definition of cosine (see
  Section~\ref{sec:trigreview}) that $1$ is an upper bound for the
  range of $\cos$ and that no smaller number is an upper
  bound. Therefore, the limit is equal to $\boxed{1}$.
\end{solution}

Definition~\ref{defn:limmon} has many restrictions: it only applies to
monotone, single-variable functions, and it is fundamentally
one-sided.* We will drop all these restrictions in one swoop:
\sidenote{* This means that only values of $r$ to the right of zero
  are considered. Often the notation $\lim_{r\to 0^+}$ is used to
  communicate the exclusion of values to the left, but this notation
  is not necessary here since the domain of $f$ includes no negative
  values}[-1cm]

\begin{defn}{Limit of a function of function of multiple
    variables}{limit_full_general} \parskip = 6pt Let $n \geq
  1$. Suppose that $D \subset \R^n$, that $\mathbf{a}\in \R^n$ and
  that $f:D \to \R$ is a function. For each $r \in (0,1)$, we consider
  the \textbf{punctured ball}
  $B^\star(\mathbf{a},r) = \{\mathbf{x} \in \R^n \,: \, 0 <
  \left|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a}\right| \leq r \}$ of radius $r$
  centered at $\mathbf{a}$. Suppose that $B^\star(\mathbf{a},r) \cap
  D$ is non-empty for all $r > 0$. 

  We define* $m(r)$ and $M(r)$ so that $[m(r),M(r)]$ is the smallest
  closed interval which contains the image of
  $B^\star(\mathbf{a},r) \cap D$ under $f$. Then we say that the limit
  of $f(\mathbf{x})$ as $\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{a}$ exists if $m(r)$
  and $M(r)$ converge to a common value $L$ as $r \to 0$. In that
  case, we say
  $\displaystyle{\lim_{\mathbf{x} \to \mathbf{a}} f(\mathbf{x}) = L}$;
  otherwise, we say that the limit does not exist. \sidenote{* Put
    another way, $m(r)$ is the greatest lower bound and $M(r)$ the
    least upper bound of the range of $f$ restricted to
    $B^\star(\mathbf{a},r) \cap D$}[-5mm]
\end{defn}

Let's begin with a function defined on $\R^1$ whose limit at the
origin doesn't exist. 

\begin{example}{}{oscill}
  Show that the limit of $\cos (1/x)$ does not exist as $x\to0$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  For any $r>0$, the function $\cos(1/x)$ has a maximum value of $1$
  and a minimum value of $-1$ in the punctured interval
  $B^\star(0,r)$, because $\cos(1/x) = 1$ whenever $x = \tfrac{1}{\pi
    k}$ for some even integer $k$, and $\cos(1/x) = -1$ whenever $x=
  \tfrac{1}{\pi k}$ for some odd integer $k$.
  
  Therefore, $M$ is the constant function $1$ and $m$
  is the constant function $-1$. These functions converge to different
  values, so the limit does not exist. 
\end{solution}

The limit in Example~\ref{exam:oscill} fails to exist because $f$ is
\textit{oscillatory} at the origin. Limit existence failures for
functions of multiple variables can look quite different: 

\begin{example}{}{pinch}
  Show that* $f(x,y) = -\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2}$ does not have a limit as
  $(x,y) \to (0,0)$. \sidenote{* See Figure~\ref{fig:limitnoshrink} for
    a graph}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Let's represent the point $(x,y)$ as* \sidenote{* We use $t$ instead
    of $r$ since we're already using $r$ as the radius of the
    punctured ball} $(t \cos \theta, t\sin \theta)$. For all $t > 0$,
  we have
  \[
    f(t\cos\theta, t\sin \theta) = \frac{ t^2 \sin \theta \cos
      \theta}{t^2(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta)} = \tfrac{1}{2} \sin
    2\theta. 
  \]
  Therefore, for any $r > 0$, we have $m(r) = -\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $M(r) =
  \tfrac{1}{2}$. Since these functions converge to unequal values as
  $r \to 0$, it follows that the limit does not exist. 
\end{solution}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Use Definition~\ref{defn:limit_full_general} to show directly that*
  $\displaystyle{\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \left[3 + x^2 - y^2\right] =
    3}$.
  \sidenote{* See Figure~\ref{fig:limitshrink} for a graph }
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Writing $f(x,y) \colonequals 3 + x^2 - y^2$ in terms of polar
  coordinates as
  $3 + t^2(\cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta) = 3 +t^2 \cos2\theta$, we
  see that the least and greatest values of $f(x,y)$ for
  $(x,y) \in B^\star((0,0),r)$ are $m(r) = 3-r^2$ and
  $M(r) = 3 + r^2$, respectively. These functions converge as $r\to 0$
  to a common value of $3$, by
  Definition~\ref{defn:limmon}. Therefore,
  $\displaystyle{\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)} \left[3 + x^2 - y^2\right] =
    3}$.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Use Definition~\ref{defn:limit_full_general} to show that
  $f(x,y) = \sin\left(\tfrac{1}{x^2 + y^2}\right)$ does not have a
  limit as $(x,y) \to (0,0)$.
\end{exercise}

In Example~\ref{exam:pinch}, there are two directions of approach
along which $f$ has different limits. Along the ray
$\theta = \tfrac{\pi}{4}$, the values of $f(x,y)$ approach*
$-\tfrac{1}{2}$. Along the ray $\theta = - \tfrac{\pi}{4}$, $f(x,y)$
converges to $\tfrac{1}{2}$. This is always an obstruction to the
existence of a limit: \sidenote{* Indeed, these values are all equal
  to $-\tfrac{1}{2}$}[-5mm]

\begin{theo}{}{}
  Suppose that $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$ are paths in the
  plane with the property that $\mathbf{r}_1(0) = (a,b)$ and
  $\mathbf{r}_2(0) = (a,b)$. If $\lim_{t \to 0}f(\mathbf{r}_1(t))$ and
  $\lim_{t \to 0}f(\mathbf{r}_2(t))$ exist and are unequal, show that 
  $\displaystyle{\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y)}$ does not exist. 
\end{theo} \bang{-1.5cm}

\begin{solution}[title=Proof]
  Let's define $L_i = \lim_{t \to 0}f(\mathbf{r}_i(t))$ for $i=1$ and
  $i=2$. Note that $m(r) \leq \min(L_1,L_2)$ for all $r > 0$ since any
  number larger than $\min(L_1,L_2)$ is not a lower bound for the
  values of the function on $B^\star((a,b),r)$. Similarly,
  $M(r) \geq \max(L_1,L_2)$ for all $r > 0$. Therefore,
  $\lim_{r\to 0} m(r) \leq \min(L_1, L_2)$ while
  $\lim_{r\to 0} M(r) \geq \max(L_1,L_2)$, so the limit of $f(x,y)$ does not
  exist as $(x,y) \to (a,b)$.

\end{solution}

With the notion of a multidimensional limit in hand, we can define
continuity the same as in the one-dimensional case.

\begin{defn}{}{continuity}
  Suppose $n \geq 2$. A function $f: \R^n \to \R$ is continuous at a
  point in $\R^n$ if and only if the limit of $f$ exists at that point
  and equals the value of the function there.

  A function $f: \R^n \to \R$ is said to be continuous if it is
  continuous at every point in $\R^n$.
\end{defn}

More generally, a function $f:D \to \R$---where $D \subset \R^n$---is
said to be continuous if it is continuous at each point in its
domain $D$. The following theorem gives us some tools for establishing
continuity. 

\begin{theo}{Continuous functions}{continuity_builders}
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin = 12pt]
  \item If $f  \!:\! \R^n \to \R$ is continuous and $g: \R \to \R$
    is continuous, then* $g\circ f :\R^n \to \R$ is
    continuous. \sidenote{$g\circ f$ denotes the \textit{composition} of
      $g$ and $f$. See Appendix~\ref{a:setsandfunctions}}
  \item A sum or product of continuous functions is continuous. 
  \item The ``coordinate-extracting'' functions $f(x,y,z) = x$, $f(x,y,z) = y$, etc., are
    continuous.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theo}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Show that $\displaystyle{\lim_{(x,y,z) \to (0,0,0)}\left(\e^{\sin x} + \frac{xyz}{1 + x^2
        z^2}\right)} = 1$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We begin by showing that $\e^{\sin x} + \frac{xyz}{1 + x^2 z^2}$ is
  continuous.  Note that $\e^{\sin x}$ is a composition of continuous
  functions: 
  \[
    (x,y,z) \mapsto x \mapsto \sin x \mapsto \e^{\sin x}, 
  \]
  Therefore, it's continuous by Theorem~\ref{th:continuity_builders}. Similarly,
  $\frac{xyz}{1 + x^2 z^2}$ is continuous wherever $1 + x^2 z^2 \neq
  0$, which is everywhere since $(xz)^2 \geq 0$. Finally, the sum of
  two continuous functions is continuous, so $\e^{\sin x} +
  \frac{xyz}{1 + x^2 z^2}$ is continuous.

  Since the function above is continuous, its limit at each point is
  equal to its value at that point. So we substitute $x=y=z=0$ and
  find that the value of the function at the origin is
  $\e^0 + \frac{0}{1+0} = 1$.
\end{solution}

Suppose we know that the limits of $f(x,y)$ along every line
passing through the origin exist and that they are all equal to some
common value $L$. Does this imply that
$\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}f(x,y) = L$? Perhaps it seems that it should,
since we've accounted for every possible angle of
approach. Remarkably, this turns out not to be the case:

\begin{example}{}{parab_nolimit}
  Show that $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}\frac{-x^2 y }{x^4 + y^2}$ does not
  exist even though the limits along every line through the origin
  exist and are equal. 
\end{example}

    \theta, t \sin \theta)$ (which is the line passing through the

    respect to the positive $x$-axis is $\theta$). We find
    \begin{align*}
      f(t\cos\theta, t \sin \theta) &= \frac{-t^3
                                      \cos^2\theta \sin \theta}{t^4 \cos^4 \theta + t^2 \sin^2 \theta} \\

  If we consider the limit of this expression as $t\to 0$ with
  $\theta$ fixed, then the $\cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$ factors are
  constants. So we see that the numerator converges to $0$ and the
  denominator converges to $\sin^2\theta$. Therefore, as long as
  $\sin \theta \neq 0$, we have
  $\lim_{t\to 0}f(t\cos\theta, t \sin \theta) = 0/\sin^2\theta =
  0$. However, if $\sin \theta = 0$, then
  $f(t\cos\theta, t \sin \theta) = 0$ for all $t$, so
  $\lim_{t\to 0}f(t\cos\theta, t \sin \theta) = 0$ in that case too.
  
  However, note that if we consider the limit along the parabolic
  path $\mathbf{r}(t) = (t, -t^2)$, we get
  \[
    f(t,-t^2) = -\frac{t^2(-t^2)}{t^4+(-t^2)^2} = \frac{1}{2}. 
  \]
  Therefore, the limit along this path is equal to
  $\tfrac{1}{2}$. Thus there are two paths (this one, as well as any
  straight-line path through the origin) along which $f$ has different
  limits. Therefore, the limit of $f(x,y)$ as $(x,y) \to (0,0)$ does
  not exist.
  
  Note: this makes sense graphically, because this function also has a
  crease along the $z$-axis. But now we have to follow a parabolic
  path to travel along the top ``ridge'' and realize a limiting value
  other than zero.

\section{Partial derivatives} \label{sec:partial}

\milink{partial_derivative_introduction}{partial derivatives}


Suppose $f$ is a function from $\R$ to $\R$. The derivative $f'$ of
$f$ is the answer to the question ``how does $f(x)$ change when $x$
changes just a little?'' More precisely, if $a\in \R$, we define
\[
  f'(a) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\overbrace{f(a+h)-f(a)}^{\text{how
        much $f$ changes}}}{\underbrace{h}_{\text{how much the input
        changes}}}
\]
This means that if we know $f'(a)$, then we can estimate
$f(a+h) - f(a)$ for $h$ very small:
\[
  f(a+h) - f(a) \approx h
  f'(a). 
\]
So the derivative measures \textbf{how sensitive $f(x)$ is to small
  changes in $x$}.

What is the most natural corresponding idea for the derivative at some
point $(a,b)$ of a function $f$ from $\R^2$ to $\R$? We were only able
to adjust a value $x\in \R$ by increasing or decreasing it a little. A
point in $\R^2$, by contrast, can be moved in any direction. Two
directions are particularly easy to study: (i) move $x$ a little while
holding $y$ fixed, and (ii) move $y$ a little while holding $x$
fixed. Accordingly, we define \textbf{partial derivatives}*
\sidenote{* $\partial_x$ is read ``partial $x$''. Also, the role of
  $x$ here is purely as a label that means ``with respect to the first
  coordinate''. It does not represent a number, as the symbol $x$
  usually does}[5mm]
\begin{align*}
  (\partial_x f)(a,b) &= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a+h,b) - f(a,b)}{h},
                        \text{ and} \\
  (\partial_y f)(a,b) &= \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a,b+h) - f(a,b)}{h}. 
\end{align*}
Calculating partial derivatives of elementary functions \textit{isn't
  actually a new skill}: since one of the two
variables is being held constant, we are effectively taking a
derivative of a single-variable function.

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the partial derivatives* $f_x$ and $f_y$ of
  $f(x,y) = \e^x \sin (xy)$ at $(x,y) = (1,0)$. \sidenote{* $f_x$ is
    an alternate notation for $\partial_x f$, and similarly for $y$}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can find the partial derivative with respect to $x$ at
  \textit{any} point $(x,y)$ by treating $y$ as constant and applying
  single-variable differentiation rules:* \sidenote{* If you have
    difficulty getting used to holding a variable constant, consider
    replacing it with some number like 17; then substitute back at the
    end}
  \begin{align*}
    (\partial_xf)(x,y) &= \e^{x} y \cos\left(x y\right) + \e^{x}
                         \sin\left(x y\right) \\  
    (\partial_yf)(x,y)  &= x \cos\left(x y\right) \e^{x}
  \end{align*}
  So the partial derivatives at $(1,0)$ with respect to $x$ and $y$
  are 0 and $e$, respectively.

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.7\textwidth} \parskip = 8pt If we increase $x$
    a little while holding $y$ constant, then $f$
    decreases. Therefore, $(\partial_x f)(1,1) < 0$. If we increase
    $y$ a little while holding $x$ constant, then $f$
    increases. Therefore, $(\partial_y f)(1,1) > 0$.

    Graphically, the partial derivative with respect to $x$ at a point
    is equal to the slope of the trace of the graph in the
    ``$y =\text{constant}$" plane passing through that

The following theorem says that order doesn't matter when successively
taking partial derivatives.

\begin{theo}{Clairaut's theorem}{clairaut}
  Suppose $f:D \to \R$, where $D$ is a disk in $\R^2$. If
  $\partial_x \partial_y f$ and $\partial_y \partial_x f$ exist and
  are continuous, then $\partial_x \partial_y f = \partial_y
  \partial_x f$ throughout $D$. 
\end{theo}

\section{Linear approximation} \label{sec:linapprox} 

\milink{linear_approximation_multivariable}{linear approximation}

The following example shows that partial derivatives don't tell the
whole story when it comes to differentiating functions of multiple
variables.

\begin{example}{}{pinchder}
  Consider the function $f$ for which $f(0,0)=0$ and $f(x,y) =
  -\frac{xy}{x^2 + y^2}$ for all $(x,y) \neq (0,0)$. Show that both
  partial derivatives of $f$ at the origin are equal to zero. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  If we move $x$ a little from $x=0$ while holding $y=0$ fixed, the
  value of $f$ doesn't change at all. Therefore,
  \[
    (\partial_x f)(0,0) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(h,0) - f(0,0)}{h} =
    \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{0}{h} =  \lim_{h \to 0} 0 = 0. 
  \]
  The same is true for the partial derivative with respect to $y$. 
\end{solution}

However, recall from Example~\ref{exam:pinch} that the function in
Example~\ref{exam:pinchder} isn't even continuous at the origin! We
haven't said yet what is required for a function of two variables to
be considered differentiable, but whatever the definition, we surely
cannot allow functions which aren't continuous to be deemed
differentiable. This shouldn't be surprising: the partial derivatives
only look at the behavior of the function along two slices. A good
definition of differentiability at $(a,b)$ should account for how the
function behaves all around $(a,b)$.

Another perspective on differentiability in the single-variable
context is that \textit{differentiable functions are the ones which
  are well-approximated by linear functions}:

\begin{theo}{}{diff_linear}
  A function $f: \R \to \R$ is differentiable at $a \in \R$ if and
  only if there exists a linear function $L(x) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) $
  such that* \sidenote{* This equation says that $L$ approximates
    $f$ so well that the difference between $f$ and $L$,
    \textit{even after being divided by the tiny number $|x-a|$}, still
    goes to 0 as $x \to a$}
  \[
    \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x) - L(x)}{|x-a|} = 0. 
  \]
\end{theo}

This perspective on differentiability turns out to generalize very
nicely to functions of multiple variables. Let's make it a definition.

\begin{defn}{Differentiability for a function of two variables}{diff}
  A function $f: \R^2 \to \R$ is differentiable at $(a,b) \in \R^2$
  if and only if there exists a linear function
  $L(x,y) = c_0 + c_{1}(x-a) + c_{2}(y-b)$ such that
  \[
    \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}\frac{f(x,y) - L(x,y)}{\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}} = 0. 
  \]
\end{defn}

Lots of functions are differentiable. The following theorem
establishes a handy way to check differentiability.

\begin{theo}{Criterion for differentiability}{partials} 
  If the partial derivatives $\partial_x f$ and $\partial_y f$ exist
  in some disk centered at $(a,b)$ and are continuous at $(a,b)$, then
  $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$. 
\end{theo}

The most common situation is that partial derivatives exist and are
continuous everywhere, in which case Theorem~\ref{th:partials} implies
that $f$ is differentiable everywhere.

\begin{example}{}{partials}
  Show that $f(x,y) = \e^{xy} \sin (x^2 + y^2)$ is differentiable at
  every point in $\R^2$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can take partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to both $x$
  and $y$ and get functions which are built from $x$ and $y$ using
  addition/multiplication as well as the continuous functions
  $x\mapsto \e^x$, $x\mapsto \sin x$, and $x\mapsto \cos
  x$. Therefore, the partial derivatives exist and are continuous
  everywhere. Thus Theorem~\ref{th:partials} implies that $f$ is
  differentiable everywhere.
\end{solution}

In the denominator we replaced $|x-a|$, whose geometric meaning is
the distance from $x$ to $a$ on the number line, with the formula
for the distance from $(x,y)$ to $(a,b)$ in the plane.

  Graphically, Definition~\ref{defn:diff} says that a function is

function $L$ are the value of the function $f$ at $a$ and the
derivative of $f$ at $a$. The coefficients in
Definition~\ref{defn:diff} are also quantities that we have names for:
as suggested by Figure~\ref{fig:tangentplane}, $c_1$ is the value of
the function at $(a,b)$ and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the two partial
derivatives at $(a,b)$.}{\usebox{\asybox}}[\captionof{figure}{A plane

\vspace{12pt} 

\begin{theo}{Linear Approximation}{linapprox}
  If $f: \R^2 \to \R$ is differentiable at $(a,b) \in \R^2$, then
  \[
    \lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)}\frac{f(x,y) - \overbrace{\left[f(a,b) + (\partial_x
          f)(a,b)(x-a) + (\partial_y
          f)(a,b)(y-b)\right]}^{L(x,y)}}{\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}} = 0.
  \]
\end{theo} \bang{-2cm} 

Let's see how this theorem can be used numerically. 

\begin{example}{}{approximate}
  Consider the function $f(x,y) = \frac{\e^{xy}}{\e(1+x^2)}$. Use a
  tangent plane to approximate $f(0.99,0.98)$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Noticing that $(0.99,0.98)$ is very close to $(1,1)$, we
  differentiate $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ and with respect to $y$ and
  find that* \sidenote{* The bar notation means ``substitute''}
  \begin{align*}
    (\partial_x f)(1,1) &= \left.\left(
                          \frac{y \e^{x y}}{\e(x^{2} + 1)} -
                          \frac{2 \, x \e^{xy}}{{\e\left(x^{2} +
                          1\right)}^{2}}\right)\right|_{(x,y)
                          =(1,1)} = 0. \\
    (\partial_y f)(1,1) &=    \left.\frac{x \e^{x y}}{\e(x^{2} +
                          1)}\right|_{(x,y) = (1,1)} = \frac{1}{2}. 
  \end{align*}
  Therefore, $f(0.99,0.98) \approx f(1,1) + 0(0.99-1) +
  \frac{1}{2}(0.98-1) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot
  (-\frac{1}{50}) = 0.49$. \sidenote{\href{https://cocalc.com/projects/7925f475-a0bd-4621-b78a-466c24c7863c/files/substitute.ipynb}{\cocalc} \, The actual value is

Let us briefly recall the Taylor* series story for functions of a
single variable. The \textbf{$k$th order Taylor polynomial} of an
$n$-times-differentiable function $f:\R \to \R$ centered at a point
$a\in \R$ is defined to be \sidenote{* A Taylor polynomial centered
  at the origin is called a \textit{Maclaurin} polynomial}
\[
  P_k(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^2 + \cdots +
  \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k. 
\]
The terms on the right-hand side are motivated by the idea that as
many derivatives of $P_k$ as possible should match those of $f$ at
the point $a$. Then $P_k$ is an excellent approximation of $f$ for
values of $x$ near $a$:

\begin{theo}{Taylor's theorem, functions of a single variable}{taylor1}
  If $I$ is an interval in $\R$ and $f: I \to \R$ is differentiable
  $k$ times, then
  \[
    \lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x) - P_k(x)}{(x-a)^k} = 0. 
  \]
\end{theo}

The idea in higher dimensions is entirely analogous: given a
function $f: \R^n \to \R$, we define the $k$th order Taylor
polynomial of $f$ at a point $\mathbf{a} \in \R^n$ to be the

\section{Multivariable optimization} \label{sec:optim} 

\milink{local_extrema_introduction_two_variables}{local extrema}

The following problem is a typical example of a single-variable
optimization problem.

\begin{example}{}{optim1d}
  Find the maximum and minimum of $f(x) = |(x - 1)(3-x)|$ over the interval
  $[0,3]$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}[b]{0.7\textwidth} \parskip = 3pt Since $f$ is
    continuous over the closed and bounded interval $[0,3]$, we know
    by the extreme value theorem* that it has a maximum and a
    minimum value over $[0,3]$. Furthermore, these extrema must be
    realized at either a \textit{critical point}, at which $f$ is
    either not differentiable or has derivative zero, or else at an
    endpoint of the interval. \sidenote{* The extreme value theorem
      for single-variable functions says that a continuous function
      on a closed interval $[a,b]$ achieves a max and a
      min}[-18mm]
    
    We check that $f$ is not differentiable at $1$ or $3$ (see the
    graph). Also, we can solve $f'(x) = 0$ to find that $f$ has a
    horizontal tangent line at $x = 2$.
    
    Finally, we can check the values of $f$ at the endpoints 0 and 3,
    as well as the critical points strictly between them, namely 1 and
    2. We find that the maximum value is $f(0) = \boxed{3}$, and the
    minimum value is $\boxed{0}$, which occurs at $x =1$ and at
    $x = 3$.

  \end{minipage}
\end{solution}

How does this story change when we consider a function of multiple
variables? For concreteness, let's suppose $D = [0,1]^2$ and that
$f:D \to \R$ is a continuous function. Consider the graph of the
function
\[
  f(x,y) = -x^2 - y^2 + x + \frac{2}{3} y + \frac{23}{36}, 
\]
shown in Example~\ref{exam:optim2d}. As in the single-variable case,
$f$ does indeed have a maximum value and a minimum value. This is
ensured by the following multivariable generalization of the
single-variable extreme value theorem.

\begin{theo}{Extreme value theorem}{evt} \parskip = 8pt 
  Suppose that $D \subset \R^n$. We say that $D$ is \textbf{closed}
  if it contains all of its boundary points. We say that $D$ is
  \textbf{bounded} if it is contained in a ball of radius $R$ for
  some $R<\infty$.

  If $D$ is closed and bounded and if $f:D \to \R$ is a continuous
  function, then $f$ achieves a maximum value and a minimum value on
  $D$. In other words, there exists $\vec{a} \in D$ such that
  $f(\vec{a}) \geq f(\vec{b})$ for all $\vec{b} \in D$. 
\end{theo}

Furthermore, if $f$ is differentiable at a point $\vec{a}$ on the
inside of $D$ and $(\partial_x f)(\vec{a}) >0$ or
$(\partial_x f)(\vec{a}) <0$, then $f$ cannot have a maximum or
minimum value at $\vec{a}$ since we can increase the function's
output value by slightly adjusting the first coordinate of
$\vec{a}$ in one direction, and we can decrease it by adjusting
it in the opposite direction. So $\partial_x f = 0$ at any value
where $f$ has an extremum, and similarly for $\partial _y f$. 

\begin{theo}{Critical points}{} \parskip = 2pt
  If $f:D \to \R$ achieves its maximum or minimum value at
  $\vec{a} \in D$, then
  \begin{enumerate}[(i),itemsep=4pt]
  \item $(\partial_x f)(\vec{a})= (\partial_yf)(\vec{a}) =
    0$, or 
  \item $f$ is not differentiable at $\vec{a}$, or
  \item $\vec{a}$ is on the boundary of $D$. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theo}

These theorems give rise to a strategy for finding the extrema of a
function $f:D \to \R$, where $D \subset \R^2$: (i) set both partial
derivatives of $f$ equal to 0 and solve to find critical points
inside $D$ (also include any points where $f$ is not
differentiable), and (ii) find the extreme values of $f$ on*
$\partial D$. Let's do an example. \sidenote{* The notation
  $\partial D$ means ``the boundary of $D$'', which is the set of
  points $p \in \R^2$ such that any small ball centered at $p$
  includes points in $D$ and points not in $D$}[-2cm]

    \end{lrbox} \raisebox{\dimexpr -\height + 1.5ex \relax}{\usebox{\asybox}}
  \end{minipage}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We begin by finding the critical points inside the square. We find
  \begin{align*}
    (\partial_xf)(x,y) &= -2x + 1  \\
    (\partial_yf)(x,y) &= -2y + \frac{2}{3}. 
  \end{align*}
  These quantities are both equal to zero only when $x =
  \tfrac{1}{2}$ and $y = \frac{1}{3}$. So $(1/2,1/3)$ is the only critical
  point inside the square.

  To optimize $f$ along the $x = 0$ side, we look at
  \[
    f(0,y) = -y^2 + \frac{2}{3}y + \frac{23}{36}, 
  \]
  which has a critical point at $y = 1/3$. So $(0,1/3)$ is a
  \textbf{boundary critical point}, and we should also check the two
  endpoints $(0,0)$ and $(0,1)$. Similarly, for the other three
  sides, we identify the points $(1,1/3)$, $(1/2,0)$, and $(1/2,1)$, as
  boundary critical points as well as the other two corners $(1,1)$
  and $(1,0)$. So, all together:
  \[
    \renewcommand\arraystretch{1.4}
    \begin{array}{c|ccccccccc}
      (x,y) &  (0,0) & (1,0) & (0,1) & (1,1) & (0,1/3) & (1,1/3) & (1/2,0) &
                                                                             (1/2,1)
      & (1/2,1/3) \\ \hline
      f(x,y) & 23/36 & 23/36 & 11/36 & 11/36 & 3/4 & 3/4 & 8/9 & 5/9
      & 1 \\
      f(x,y) & 0.64 & 0.64 & 0.31 & 0.31 & 0.75 & 0.75 & 0.89 & 0.56
      & 1
    \end{array}
  \]
  So the maximum value is $\boxed{1}$ and the minimum value is
  $\boxed{\tfrac{11}{36}}$. 
\end{solution}

\section{Second derivative test} \label{sec:second_test}

Recall from single-variable calculus that the second derivative of a
twice-differentiable function can---if it is nonzero---be used to
ascertain whether a function has a local minimum* or a local maximum
at a given critical point. This is because the convexity of a
twice-differentiable function indicates whether the graph of the
function is shaped like \includegraphics{figures/smallup} or
\includegraphics{figures/smalldown}. \sidenote{* A function $f$ has
  a local minimum at a point $\mathbf{a}$ if there is a small
  neighborhood of $\mathbf{a}$ throughout which the function's
  values are no smaller than $f(\mathbf{a})$}[-1cm]

The situation in higher dimensions is more subtle. Archetypal
examples are 
\begin{enumerate}[(a),topsep=-6pt,itemsep=4pt]
\item $x^2 + y^2$, which has a bowl-shaped graph like
  \raisebox{-3pt}{\includegraphics{figures/smallbowl}}, and so a local
  minimum at the origin,
\item $-x^2 - y^2$, which has an umbrella-shaped graph like
  \raisebox{-3pt}{\includegraphics{figures/smallumbrella}}, and so a
  local maximum at the origin, and
\item $x^2 - y^2$, which has a saddle-shaped graph like
  \raisebox{-3pt}{\includegraphics{figures/smallsaddle}}, and so
  neither a local min nor a local max at the origin.
\end{enumerate}

The following theorem gives us a direct way to distinguish these
cases.

\newcommand\secondderivativetest{
  Suppose that $U$ is an open set in $\R^2$ and $f:U \to \R$ is a
  twice-differentiable function with a critical point at $(a,b)$. We
  define
  $D = (\partial_{x}^2f \, \partial_{y}^2f-[\partial_x\partial_y
  f]^2)(a,b)$. Then* \sidenote{* When $D=0$, this theorem doesn't tell us
    anything}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a),itemsep=4pt]
  \item if $D > 0$ and $(\partial_x^2 f)(a,b) > 0$, then $f$ has a
    local minimum at $(a,b)$, 
  \item if $D > 0$ and $(\partial_x^2 f)(a,b) < 0$, then $f$ has a
    local maximum at $(a,b)$, and 
  \item if $D < 0$, then $f$ has a saddle point at $(a,b)$.

  minimum, a local maximum, or a saddle point.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We have
  \begin{align*}
    \partial_x f &= 2 x \left(- 2 x^{2} - 3 y^{2} + 2\right) \e^{-

  \end{align*}
  To find the critical points of $f$, we look for all pairs $(x,y)$
  for which both of these expressions are equal to zero. We see that
  $x=0$ implies $\partial_x f = 0$. In that case, we have
  $\partial_y f = 0$ if and only if $y \in \{-1,0,1\}$. Similarly,
  $y = 0$ implies $\partial_y f = 0$, and in that case we have
  $\partial_x f = 0$ only if $x \in \{-1,0,1\}$. If neither $x$ nor
  $y$ is zero, then we may divide the two equations by $x$ and $y$,
  respectively, and we arrive at a contradiction since the

  equal to zero. Therefore, we have found all the critical points.

\section{Directional derivative and gradient} \label{sec:dd_and_grad} 

\milink{directional_derivative_gradient_introduction}{directional derivatives and the gradient}

The two partial derivatives of a function $f: \R^2 \to \R$ tell us
how $f$ changes when $(x,y)$ is wiggled a bit, but only in the four
cardinal directions.* What about all the other directions? Suppose
that $\mathbf{u}$ is a \textbf{unit vector} in $\R^2$, meaning that its
length is 1. (see
Figure~\ref{fig:dirder}). \sidenote{* That is: \\ up/down,
  left/right}[-6mm]

\begin{defn}{Directional derivative}{dirder}
  The \textbf{directional derivative} of a function $f:\R^2 \to \R$
  in the direction $\mathbf{u} \in \R^2$ is defined by
  \[
    D_{\mathbf{u}}(f)(a,b) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f( (a,b) + h
      \mathbf{u}) - f(a,b)}{h}. 
  \]  
\end{defn}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth} \parskip = 0.2 in
  In other words, move $(x,y)$ a small distance $h$ in the
  $\mathbf{u}$ direction, measure how much $f$ changed, and then
  divide by $h$.

  If $f$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$, then it is well-approximated
  by a linear function $L(x,y) = c_0 + c_1(x-a) + c_2(y-b)$ around
  $(a,b)$. This linear function has the property that its slope in
  the $\mathbf{u}$ direction can be worked out by separating the
  $h\mathbf{u}$-step into a $\langle hu_1, 0 \rangle$ step followed
  by a $\langle 0, hu_2 \rangle$ step. The value of $L$ changes by
  $hc_1u_1$ over the $\langle hu_1, 0 \rangle$ step and by
  $hc_2u_2$ over the $\langle 0, hu_2 \rangle$ step. Altogether, the
  change of $L$ is equal to $(c_1u_1 + c_2u_2 )h$. This
  leads to the following theorem.

    $\mathbf{u}$ \label{fig:dirder}}
\end{minipage}

\begin{theo}{Directional derivative formula}{dirder}
  If $f:\R^2 \to \R$ is differentiable at $(a,b)$ and
  $ \mathbf{u} \in \R^2$, then
  \[
    D_{\mathbf{u}} f(a,b) = (\partial_xf)(a,b)u_1 +
    (\partial_yf)(a,b)u_2 =  (\nabla f)(a,b) \cdot \mathbf{u}, 
  \]
  where $(\nabla f)(a,b)= \langle (\partial_x f)(a,b), (\partial_y f)(a,b) \rangle$. 
\end{theo}

The quantity $(\nabla f)(a,b)$ introduced in
Theorem~\ref{th:dirder}---the vector of partial derivatives of $f$
at $(a,b)$---is called the \textbf{gradient} of $f$ at
$(a,b)$. Observe that the directional derivative of $f$ at $(a,b)$
in the $\mathbf{u}$ direction is equal to
$\nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u} = |\nabla f| \cos \theta$, where $\theta$
is the angle between $\nabla f$ and $\mathbf{u}$. Since $\cos\theta$
is maximized when $\theta = 0$, we see that \textbf{the gradient of
  $f$ at $(a,b)$ is $f$'s direction of maximum increase at
  $(a,b)$}. Furthermore, the direction opposite to the gradient is
the direction of maximum decrease, and $f$ has zero derivative in
any direction orthogonal to the gradient. \bang{-10mm}

The function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ which maps $(a,b)$ to $(\nabla
f)(a,b)$ is called the gradient of $f$ and is denoted $\nabla
f$. Thus the \textit{gradient  of $f$ at a point} is a vector, while
the \textit{gradient of $f$} is a vector-valued function defined on
$\R^2$. 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find $(\nabla f)(3,4)$, where $f(x,y) = x^2 + xy + y^2$. Find all
  possible values of $D_{\mathbf{u}}f(3,4)$, where $\mathbf{u}$ is
  any unit vector. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We have $(\partial_xf)(x,y)= 2x + y$ and $(\partial_y f)(x,y) = 2y
  + x$, so
  \[
    \nabla f = \langle 2x + y, 2y + x \rangle. 
  \]
  Therefore, the gradient evaluated at $(3,4)$ is equal to
  $\boxed{\langle 10,11\rangle}$.

  Since  $D_{\mathbf{u}}f(3,4) = \langle 10,11\rangle \cdot
  \mathbf{u} = \sqrt{221}\cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle
  between $\langle 10,11\rangle$ and $\mathbf{u}$, we see that as
  $\mathbf{u}$ ranges over the unit circle, the directional
  derivative of $\mathbf{f}$ in the $\mathbf{u}$ direction ranges
  over $\boxed{[-\sqrt{221}, \sqrt{221}]}$.

The gradient of a function from $\R^3$ to $\R$ is likewise defined to
be the vector of its partial derivatives:
$\nabla f = \langle \partial_x f, \partial_y f, \partial_z f
\rangle$. The formula $D_{\mathbf{u}} f = \nabla f \cdot \mathbf{u}$
holds for all differentiable functions $f:\R^3 \to \R$ and
$\mathbf{u} \in \R^3$.

  Find the equation of a plane tangent to the ellipsoid $x^2 + y^2 +

  The ellipsoid is a level set of the function
  $g(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + 2z^2$. The direction vectors $\mathbf{u}$
  contained in the plane of tangency at $(1,1,1)$ are characterized
  by the fact that $g$ is unchanging in the $\mathbf{u}$
  direction at $(1,1,1)$. Since
  $D_{\mathbf{u}}g = \nabla g \cdot \mathbf{u}$, this means that*
  $\mathbf{u}$ is orthogonal to $\nabla g$. So we calculate
  \sidenote{* All together: \textbf{the gradient of a function at

  \]
  and see that the desired plane is orthogonal to $\langle 2, 2, 4
  \rangle$ and passes through $(1,1,1)$. So the equation of the
  plane is 
  \[
    \langle 2, 2, 4 \rangle \cdot \langle x - 1, y - 1, z - 1
    \rangle = 0 \implies \boxed{x + y + 2z = 4}.

\section{The multivariable chain rule} \label{sec:chainrule} 

\milink{chain_rule_multivariable_introduction}{the chain rule}

The basic idea of the chain rule is that when considering how
$f(g(t))$ changes when we increase $t$ by some small amount $h$, we
can note that $g(t)$ changes by approximately $hg'(t)$, and that
change in the input to $f$ induces a change of
\[
  f(g(t+h)) - f(g(t)) \approx \left(
    \overbrace{hg'(t)}^{\text{change in input to $f$}} 
  \right) \left( 
    \overbrace{f'(g(t))}^{\text{sensitivity of
        $f$ to change in input}}
  \right) 
\]
in the value of $f(g(t))$. Thus $\tfrac{\d}{\d t} f(g(t)) =
g'(t)f'(g(t))$. 

The simplest multivariable generalization of this idea is to define a
function from $\R$ to $\R$ by composing a function $\mathbf{r}: \R
\to \R^2$
with a function $f: \R^2 \to \R$. Let's look at an example.

\begin{example}{}{chainrule}
  Suppose $f(x,y) = \sin xy \cos y$ and $\mathbf{r}(t) = (\e^t,
  t^2)$. Find the derivative of $f \circ \mathbf{r}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can calculate directly
  \[
    (f \circ \mathbf{r})(t) = f(\mathbf{r}(t)) = \sin (t^2\e^t) \cos
    t^2. 
  \]
  So the desired derivative is
  \begin{align*}
    \cos(t^2\e^t)\left[ t^2 \e^t + 2t\e^t\right] &\cos t^2  -
     \sin(t^2 \e^t) 2t \sin t^2  \\
    &=t^2 \e^t \cos(t^2 \e^t) \cos t^2 + 2t\e^t \cos(t^2 \e^t) \cos t^2 -
                           2t \sin(t^2 \e^t) \sin t^2. 
  \end{align*}
\end{solution}

The multivariable chain rule gives us an alternative approach which
describes the relationship between $(f\circ \mathbf{r})'(t)$ and the
derivatives of $f$ and $\mathbf{r}$. Let's write
$\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle r_1(t), r_2(t) \rangle$.  When we change
$t$ by $h$, the value of $f(\mathbf{r}(t))$ changes as follows: 
\[
  f\left(
    \overbrace{r_1(t)}^{\text{changes by $hr_1'(t)$}},
    \overbrace{r_2(t)}^{\text{changes by $hr_2'(t)$}}
  \right)
\]
The change of $hr_1'(t)$ in the first argument induces a change of
$hr_1'(t) (\partial_xf)(\mathbf{r}(t))$ in the value of $f$, while
the change of $hr_2'(t)$ in the second argument induces a change of
$hr_2'(t) (\partial_yf)(\mathbf{r}(t))$. By linear approximation,
the overall change is the sum of these two changes. Dividing by $h$
and taking $h \to 0$ then gives the following theorem.

\begin{theo}{Multivariable chain rule}{chainrule}
  If $f : \R^2 \to \R$ and $\mathbf{r} = \langle r_1,  r_2\rangle :
  \R \to \R^2$,
  are differentiable, then
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:chainrule} 
    (f\circ \mathbf{r})'(t) = (\partial_x f)(\mathbf{r}(t))r_1'(t) +
    (\partial_y f)(\mathbf{r}(t))r_2'(t) = (\nabla f)(\mathbf{r}(t))
    \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t). 
  \end{equation}
\end{theo}

The chain rule \eqref{eq:chainrule} can be written with the more suggestive
notation* \sidenote{* $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ means $\partial_x f$}[3mm]
\[
  \frac{\d f}{\d t} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{\d x}{\d t} +
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{\d y}{\d t}, 
\]
where $x$ and $y$ represent $r_1$ and $r_2$. Although this formula
is more memorable, it does involve some abuse of notation: the
symbols $x$ and $y$ are being used* as independent variables (in the
partial derivative expressions) and as function names (in
$\d x/\d t$ and $\d y/\d t$). Also, on the left-hand side $f$ is
being treated as a function of a single variable; actually this
instance of $f$
is shorthand for the single-variable function $f\circ \mathbf{r}$.
\sidenote{* using the same symbol to mean different things (relying
  on context to distinguish) is called \textit{overloading} the
  symbol}[-1cm]

Consider the function

\]
which we optimized over the square $[0,1]^2$ in
Example~\ref{exam:optim2d}. In that case, we identified possible
extreme values on the boundary of the square by doing a
single-variable optimization along each edge of the square. But
suppose that we want to find the maximum and minimum values of $f$
over a disk $D$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:lagrange})? Let's consider the
disk $D$ of radius $\tfrac{1}{2}$ centered at
$\left(\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}\right)$.

We could actually take a similar approach to this problem. We can
parameterize* the boundary of the disk as \sidenote{* To
  \textit{parameterize} a curve means to find a path which traces it
  out}
\[
  \mathbf{r}(t) = \left\langle \tfrac{1}{2} + \tfrac{1}{2} \cos t,

  \caption{$\mathbf{q}$ is a boundary critical point and $\mathbf{p}$ is not \label{fig:lagrange2}}
\end{wrapfigure}

However, this approach is limited because it requires a
parameterization of the boundary of $D$, which is not always
convenient. Suppose that $\partial D$ is specified as a level set of
some function $g: \R^2 \to \R$. For example, the
circle in Figure~\ref{fig:lagrange} is a level set $\left\{(x,y) \, :
  g(x,y) = \tfrac{1}{2}\right\}$ of the function
\[
  g(x,y) = \left(x-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2. 
\]
Let's derive an approach to finding the extreme values on the
boundary which begins with the functions $f$ (the \textit{objective}
function) and $g$ (the \textit{constraint} function).


Imagine a bug moving around on the edge of the graph in
Figure~\ref{fig:lagrange}. How can it tell that it is \textit{not} at
a maximum or minimum? One approach is to calculate the gradient of $f$
at its location. If the gradient of $f$ is not orthogonal to
$\partial D$, then the value of the function can be increased by
sliding a bit in one direction* and can be decreased by sliding a bit
in the opposite direction. So, for example, in
Figure~\ref{fig:lagrange2}, a bug at the point $p$ could increase the
value of $f$ at its location by moving slightly clockwise and decrease
the value of $f$ by moving slightly counterclockwise around
$\partial D$. \sidenote{* Specifically, the direction where $\nabla f$
  is leaning (that is, the direction whose dot product with $\nabla f$
  is positive)}[-1cm]

Therefore, if the gradient of $f$ at a point is \textit{not}
orthogonal to $\partial D$, then $f$ does not have an extreme value
there. So to find points where $f$ might have an extreme value on
$\partial D$, we can restrict our attention to the points where
$\partial f$ is orthogonal to $\partial D$.

We can simplify this idea further: recall that the gradient of $g$ at
each point is orthogonal to the level set of $g$ passing through that
point. It follows that if $\partial D$ is a level set of $g$ and
$p \in \partial D$ is a point where $f$ has an extreme value, then
$\nabla g$ and $\nabla f$ are both orthogonal to $\partial D$. If
$\nabla g \neq \mathbf{0}$, this means that they are parallel! By
Observation~\ref{obs:vecparallel}, then, there exists a scalar
$\lambda$ such that $\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g$.

\begin{theo}{Method of Lagrange multipliers}{lagrange}
  Suppose $f: \R^n \to \R$ and $g:\R^n \to \R$ are differentiable
  functions and $c \in \R$. If the restriction of $f$ to the level
  set* $\{\mathbf{x} \in \R^n \,: g(\mathbf{x}) = c\}$ has a local
  extremum at $\mathbf{x} \in \R^n$, then either $\nabla g(\mathbf{x}) =
  \mathbf{0}$ or 
  \[
    \nabla f (\mathbf{x}) = \lambda \nabla g (\mathbf{x}). 
  \]
\end{theo} \sidenote{* So far we've been considering the restriction
  of $f$ to the boundary of a region $D$, but any level set of a
  differential function $g$ will do}[-2cm]

\bang{15mm} 
Theorem~\ref{th:lagrange} implies that we can optimize $f(\mathbf{x})$ subject
to the constraint $g(\mathbf{x}) = c$ by solving the system of \textbf{Lagrange
  equations}
\[
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{r@{\:}c@{\:}l}
      \nabla f (\mathbf{x}) &=& \lambda \nabla g (\mathbf{x})\\
      g(\mathbf{x}) &=& c, 
    \end{array}
  \right. 
\]
with the only caveat that we have to watch out for the possibility
that $\nabla g = \mathbf{0}$. Let's see how this works out for the
example from the beginning of the section.

\begin{example}{}{lagrange}
  Find the maximum and minimum values of
  \[f(x,y) = -x^2 - y^2 + x + \frac{2}{3} y + \frac{23}{36}\]
  over the disk of radius $\tfrac{1}{2}$ centered at $\left(
    \tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{2}\right)$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The only interior critical point is
  $\left(\tfrac{1}{2},\tfrac{1}{3}\right)$, as in
  Example~\ref{exam:optim2d}. To find boundary critical points, we
  use
  $g(x,y) = \left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y -
    \frac{1}{2}\right)^2$ as our constraint function and set up the
  Lagrange equations
  \begin{align} \nonumber
    \partial_x f &= \lambda \, \partial_x g \\ \nonumber
    \partial_y f &= \lambda \, \partial_y g \implies \\ 
    -2x + 1 &= \lambda(2x - 1)  \\ \label{eq:eq2}
    -2y + \tfrac{2}{3} &= \lambda(2y-1). 
  \end{align}
  We're looking for pairs $(x,y)$ which satisfy both of these
  equations \textbf{and} the equation
  \begin{equation} 
    g(x,y) = \left(x-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 +
    \left(y-\tfrac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \tfrac{1}{4} \\ 
  \end{equation}
  since
  $(x,y)$ must be on $\partial D$. So we have three equations and three
  variables: $x$, $y$, and $\lambda$. The first equation implies
  that either $\lambda = -1$ or $x = \tfrac{1}{2}$.

  In the case $x = \frac{1}{2}$, we can use the constraint equation
  to conclude that $y = 0$ or $y = 1$. In either case, we can
  substitute into \eqref{eq:eq2} to get a value for $\lambda$ so
  that all three equations are satisfied. So, we have
  $(x,y) = (1/2, 0)$ and $(1/2,1)$ as boundary critical points.

  If $x \neq \tfrac{1}{2}$, then $\lambda = -1$. Substituting into
  \eqref{eq:eq2} gives a contradiction, which means that we've
  already found all the boundary critical points.

  Finally, we evaluate $f$ at the interior critical point and the
  two boundary critical points: \vspace{-12pt}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{M{1.2cm}|M{1.2cm}M{1.2cm}M{1.2cm}N}
      $(x,y)$ & $\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$  & $\left(\frac{1}{2},
                                                 1\right)$ &
                                                             $\left(\frac{1}{2},
                                                             \frac{1}{3} \right)$ &
      \\[12pt] \hline  \\[-8pt] 
      $f(x,y)$ & $\frac{8}{9}$ & $\frac{5}{9}$ & 1 &  \\
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  So the maximum of $f$ over $D$ is $1$, and the minimum is
  $\frac{5}{9}$. 
\end{solution}

The following example is a 3D application of Lagrange multipliers. 

\begin{example}{}{lagrange3d}
  Find the maximum possible volume of a box made with 72 square
  centimeters of cardboard and having sides and a bottom but no
  top. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Denote by $x,y$, and $z$ the dimensions (in centimeters) of the
  cardboard. Then the amount of cardboard used is
  \[
    g(x,y,z) = 2yz + 2xz + xy = 72, 
  \]
  while the objective function is the volume $f(x,y,z) =
  xyz$. Setting up the Lagrange equations, we get
  \begin{align*}
    yz &= \lambda(2z + y) \\
    xz &= \lambda(2z + x) \\
    xy &= \lambda(2x + 2y) \\
    2yz + 2xz + xy &= 72, 
  \end{align*}
  where the last one is the constraint equation. Multiplying the
  first two equations by $x$ and $y$, respectively, and setting
  the resulting right-hand sides equal implies that either $\lambda
  = 0$ or $z= 0$ or  $x = y$. Since $\lambda = 0$ or $z = 0$ clearly
  give zero volume (and thus not the maximum volume), it follows
  that $x=y$. Substituting $y$ for $x$ in the third equation gives*
  \sidenote{* Once again, we can divide by $x$ because we know
    that $ x= 0$ wouldn't make sense for the maximum volume}
  \[
    x^2 = 4 \lambda x \implies \lambda = \tfrac{x}{4}. 
  \]
  Substituting this into the second equation and simplifying, we get
  $x = 2z$. Finally, substituting into the constraint equation gives
  $z = \sqrt{6}$, which in turn implies $x = y = 2\sqrt{6}$. 
\end{solution}

\chapter{Multivariable Integration}

To find the area under the graph of a continuous function $f$ over the
unit interval $[0,1]$, we first approximate the area by splitting
$[0,1]$ into many short intervals and sum up the areas of rectangles
approximating the area under the graph over each short interval:
\begin{center}
  \begin{asy}
    defaultpen(fontsize(10)); 
    size(12cm);
    import graph;
    real f(real x){ return 1/4*x*x;}
    picture gr; 
    draw(gr,graph(f,0,2),MidnightBlue);
    draw(gr,(0,0)--(2,0));
    draw(gr,(0,0)--(0,1));
    real eps = 0.05; 
    draw(gr,Label("1",Relative(1),align=S),(2,0)--(2,-eps)); 
    label(gr,"$x$",(2,0),align=E,MidnightBlue);
    label(gr,"$f(x)$",(0,1.05),align=N,MidnightBlue);
    
    int n = 15;
    add(gr); 
    for(int i=0;i< 2*n; ++i){
      filldraw(box((i/n,0),((i+1)/n,f(i/n))),softgreen,MidnightBlue); 
    }
    label("$\displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f\left(\frac{i}{n}\right) \frac{1}{n}}$", (0.6,0.6)); 
    add(shift((3,0))*gr);
    draw((2.3,1/2)--(2.7,1/2),MidnightBlue,Arrow(3));
    label("$\displaystyle{\int_0^1 f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}$", (3.6,0.6)); 
    filldraw(shift((3,0))*(graph(f,0,2)--(2,0)--cycle),softgreen,MidnightBlue);
    real eps = 0.05;
  \end{asy}
\end{center}
This approximation converges to the actual area under the graph as
$n \to \infty$.

In this section we will work out how to generalize this concept to
integrate of functions of multiple variables over regions in $\R^2$ or
$\R^3$.* \sidenote{* See Appendix~\ref{sec:centralidea} for a more
  in-depth discussion of integration} 

\section{Double integration} \label{sec:double}

\milink{double_integral_introduction}{double integrals} 

We can state the definition of the integral, described above, more
informally and generally: split the region of integration into many
tiny pieces, multiply the volume* of each piece by the value of the
function at some point on that piece*, and add up the results. If we
take the number of pieces to $\infty$ and the piece size to zero, then
this sum should converge to a number, and if it does then we declare
that number to be the value of the integral.  \sidenote{* Recall our
  convention that 1D volume is length and 2D volume is area}[-1.85cm]
\sidenote{* It doesn't ultimately matter where we evaluate the
  function, since the piece is very small and the function is
  continuous. If we want an overestimate/underestimate of the
  integral, we can use the maximum/minimum of the function on each
  piece}[-2mm]

Stated at this level of generality, the idea of the integral
definition applies to a function $f: \R^2 \to \R$ over a bounded
region $D \subset \R^2$. See Figure~\ref{fig:integraldef} for an
illustration, and see Appendix~\ref{sec:riemannintegral} for a more
general definition.
\begin{defn}{Integral over a 2D region}{twoDintegral}
  Suppose $f: \R^2 \to \R$ is a continuous function, and that $D$ is
  a bounded region in $\R^2$ such that $\partial D$ has zero
  area. Then the limit* \sidenote{* The notation means that the sum
    includes one term for each integer pair $(i,j)$ such that
    $(i/n,j/n)$ is in the region $D$}[14mm]
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:def2D}
    \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{(i,j) \, : \left(\frac{i}{n,} \,\frac{j}{n}\right) \in D}
    f\left(\frac{i}{n,}\,\frac{j}{n}\right)
    \overbrace{\frac{1}{n^2}}^{\Delta A}

  exists. We define the integral of $f$ over $D$, denoted
  $\iint_D f\, \d A$ or $\int_D f \, \d A$, to be the value of this limit.

We can express this process more succinctly as
\begin{equation} \label{eq:iteratedintegral} 
  \int_0^1 \int_0^1 y \sin (\pi xy) \, \d x \, \d y =
  \int_0^1 \frac{1-\cos \pi y}{\pi}\, \d y = \frac{1}{\pi}. 
\end{equation}
The first expression in \eqref{eq:iteratedintegral} is called an
\textbf{iterated integral}, since it expresses an integral over a 2D
region in terms of two successive single-variable integrals.

Let's see how this works over a non-rectangular region.

\begin{example}{}{integraltriangle}
  Find the integral over the triangle $T$ with vertices $(0,0)$,
  $(2,0)$, and $(0,3)$ of the function $f(x,y) = x^2y$, by first
  finding the area under each `$y=\text{constant}$' slice.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.65\textwidth}
    As in the previous example, we slice up the desired volume making
    many `$y=\text{constant}$' cuts of thickness $\Delta y$, yielding
    thin slices such that each one has volume (very close to)
    $A(y)\Delta y$, where $y$ is the slice's signed distance from the
    $xz$-plane and $A(y)$ is the area of the cross-section (see
    figure). Since this cross section is an area under a curve, we can
    find it by integrating $x\mapsto f(x,y)$ over the set of relevant
    $x$-values:* \sidenote{* We can find the formula
      $2 - \tfrac{2}{3}y$ by writing an equation for the line
      connecting $(2,0)$ to $(0,3)$ and solving for $x$}
    \[
      A(y) = \int_{0}^{2 - \frac{2}{3} y} f(x,y) \, \d x. 
    \]
    Thus
    $A(y) = \frac{1}{3}\left( 2- \frac{2}{3} y\right)^3 y
    $. 
    Finally, adding up all these areas and taking $\Delta y \to 0$
    gives the result 
    \[
      \int_0^3 A(y) \, \d y = \int_0^3 \left(-\frac{8}{81} \, y^{4} +
        \frac{8}{9} \, y^{3} - \frac{8}{3} \, y^{2} + \frac{8}{3} \, y \right)\,
      \d y = \boxed{\frac{6}{5}}.

\section{Triple integration} \label{sec:triple} 

\milink{triple_integral_introduction}{triple integrals}

We interpret the integral of a single-variable function as an area and
the integral of a two-variable function as a volume. So how should we
interpret the integral of a function of \textit{three} variables over
a region $D$ in $\R^3$?  \textit{Four-dimensional volume} is a
reasonable answer, but of course this is unsatisfactory from a
visualization point of view, since we don't have access to four
spatial dimensions with which to visualize.

Therefore, let's consider a physics interpretation of integration
which permits a visualization \textit{not} involving the graph of the
function being integrated.

\begin{example}{}{}
  Consider a square plate occupying the square $[1,3]^2$ whose density
  at each point is $\sigma(x,y) = xy$ kilograms per square unit.* Find
  the mass of the plate. \sidenote{* See the figure in the solution,
    where darker color indicates a denser portion of the plate}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
    Let's imagine physically cutting the plate into small squares,
    computing the mass of each one, and adding up the resulting
    masses. The mass of a small plate of area $\Delta x \Delta y$
    containing the point $(x,y)$ is approximately the area density
    times the area: $\sigma(x,y) \, \Delta x \, \Delta y$. The sum of
    these masses is a Riemann sum (see
    Definition~\ref{defn:twoDintegral}) which converges as the number
    of small squares goes to $\infty$ to the integral
    \[
      \int_1^3 \int_1^3 xy \, \d x \, \d y = \boxed{16} \text{ kilograms}.

\end{solution}

Let's do a three-dimensional example.

\begin{example}{}{}
  Consider a cubical block occupying $D = [1,2]^3$ whose density at each
  point is $\delta(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ kilograms per cubic unit.
  Find the mass of the block. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.65\textwidth} 
    We cut the cube into $n^3$ small cubes, where $n$ is a large
    integer. The mass of one of these cubes with bottom, back* corner
    $(x,y,z)$ is approximately equal to the product of its volume
    $\tfrac{1}{n^3}$ and the approximate density $\delta(x,y,z)$
    throughout the small cube. So the approximate volume is
    \sidenote{* Any corner, or indeed any point in the cube, would
      give the same result---we choose the bottom, back corner (the
      point nearest the origin) for concreteness}[-1cm]
    \[
      \sum_{\text{all cubes}} \delta\left(x,y,z\right) \frac{1}{n^3}. 
    \]
    Intuitively, this sum should converge to a limit as $n\to\infty$,
    and if so, then we should define the limiting value to be the
    integral of $\delta$ over $D$. Let's state this idea for any
    continuous function $f:\R^3 \to \R$: we define the integral of $f$
    over $D$ by
    \[
      \iiint_D f(x,y,z) \, {\d}V = \lim_{n\to\infty} \sum_{(i,\,j,\,k) \,:
        \left(\frac{i}{n,} \, \frac{j}{n,} \, \frac{k}{n} \right) \in D}
      f\left(\frac{i}{n,} \, \frac{j}{n,} \, \frac{k}{n}
      \right)\frac{1}{n^3}.

  We can calculate the integral by slicing up the region of
  integration into thin slabs along `$z = \text{constant}$' slices,
  and then performing double integrals to find the area of each
  slab. This works the same as double iterated integration, but with
  one extra step. Rather than writing $\Delta z$ and then taking a
  limit to turn $\Delta z$ into $dz$, we'll skip to the limit and work
  directly with $dz$* \sidenote{* This is a general theme: we contract
    the following two steps into a single step (by writing $dz$
    instead of $\Delta z$ from the outset): (i) reason about sums
    involving a small but positive quantity $\Delta z$, and (ii)
    replace the sum with an integral over the relevant $z$ values and
    replace $\Delta z$ with $dz$ }
  \begin{align*}
    \text{mass} &= \int_1^2 \overbrace{\int_1^2 \int_1^2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) \, \d x
                  \, \d y \, {\d}z}^{\text{mass of slice from $z$ to $z + dz$}} \\
                &= \int_1^2 \int_1^2 \left(y^{2} + z^{2} + \frac{7}{3}\right) \, \d y
                  \, {\d}z \\
                &= \int_1^2 \left(z^2 + \frac{14}{3}\right) \, {\d}z \\
                &= \boxed{7} \text{ kilograms}.

The following theorem summarizes the idea of integrating in 3D by
breaking down the 3D region of integration into 2D slices.

\begin{theo}{Iterated integrals for three-variable functions}{iterated3}
  Suppose $f$ is a continuous function over a region $D$ which is
  bounded between the planes $z = a$ and $z = b$. For each
  $z \in (a,b)$, define $D_z \subset \R^2$ to be the region*
  \sidenote{* $D_z$ is the region obtained by intersecting $D$ with
    the plane which is $z$ units from the $xy$-plane and then dropping
    off the third coordinate}
  \[
    D_z = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \, : \, (x,y,z) \in D\}. 
  \]
  Then
  \[
    \iiint _D f \, {\d}V =
    \int_a^b \left[\iint_{D_z} f(x,y,z) \, \d x \, \d y \right] \, {\d}z, 
  \]
\end{theo}

Let's break this theorem down into a simple algorithm (the following
observation is the 3D analogue of
Observation~\ref{obs:evaluating_integrals}):

\begin{obs}{Limits of integration over a 3D
    region}{evaluating_3d_integrals}
  To set up an iterated integral to evaluate $\iiint_D f \, {\d}V$
  (where $f$ is continuous and $D$ is a region which intersects every
  line parallel to the $x$-axis in an interval): 
  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt, topsep = 8pt, leftmargin = 12pt]
  \item Find the least and greatest $z$ values for any point in
    $D$. These are your \textbf{outer limits} of integration. 
  \item For each fixed `$z=\text{constant}$' plane which intersects $D$, identify
    the least and greatest values of $y$ for any point which is in $D$
    \textit{and on that plane}, expressed in terms of the vertical
    position $z$ of the plane. These are the \textbf{middle limits} of
    integration, and they may depend on $z$.
  \item For each line of the form
    `$z=\text{constant and }y=\text{constant}$' which intersects $D$,
    find the least and greatest values of $x$ for any point which is
    in $D$ \textit{and on that line}. These are your \textbf{inner
      limits} of integration, and they may depend on both $z$ and $y$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{obs}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the volume of the tetrahedron with vertices $(0,0,0)$,
  $(2,0,0)$, $(0,3,0)$, and $(0,0,4)$ using a triple integral.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth} \parskip = 0.2 in 
    The volume of a region is equal to the integral of the constant
    function 1 over that region:
    \[
      \text{volume}(D) = \iiint_D 1 \, {\d}V, 
    \]
    because $\iiint_D 1 \, {\d}V$ is equal to the mass of a solid
    occupying the region $D$ and having density 1 at every point. But
    if a solid has a constant mass density of 1, then its mass is
    equal to its volume.* \sidenote{* Alternatively, note that
      calculating the Riemann sums approximating $\iiint_D 1 \, {\d}V$
      amounts to splitting $D$ into small pieces and summing their
      volumes}

    So we set up our iterated integral: the least and greatest values
    of $z$ are 0 and 4, so those are our outer limits. For a fixed
    value of $z$, the least and greatest values of $y$ for a point in
    $D$ are 0 and $3 - \tfrac{3}{4}z$, respectively. Finally, for
    fixed $y$ and $z$, the least and greatest values of $x$ for a
    point in $D$ are 0 and the point on the plane $6x + 4y + 3z = 12$
    with the given values of $y$ and $z$ (see figure).

\section{Polar, cylindrical, and spherical integration} \label{sec:polar_int}

Some regions in $\R^2$ are more conveniently described in polar
coordinates than rectangular coordinates. If we are integrating a
function $f: \R^2 \to \R$ over such a region, it is helpful to work
directly in polar coordinates. Let's do an example.

\begin{example}{}{polarintegral}
  (i) Find the area of the region $D$ enclosed by the solution set of
  the polar coordinate equation $r = 1 + \cos \theta$. (ii) Integrate
  the function $f(x,y) = x + y$ over $D$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.57\textwidth}
    \parskip = 0.2 in 
    (i) Let's slice $D$ into small pieces using equally
    spaced cuts along
    rays and circles of the form $r = \text{constant}$ and
    $\theta = \text{constant}$, as shown. This decomposes $D$
    into a set of \textbf{coordinate patches}. The figure suggests that
    these pieces farther away from the origin are larger than the ones
    that are close to the origin, which leads us to investigate the
    area of each patch. 

    To find the area of the set of points with radial polar coordinate between
    $r$ and $r+\Delta r$ and angular polar coordinate between $\theta$
    and $\theta + \Delta \theta$, we note that this region is
    approximately a rectangle. The straight side length is $\Delta r$,
    and the curvy side length is $r \Delta \theta$, because the perimeter of
    the circle of radius $r$ is $2\pi r$, and the angle represents
    $\frac{\theta}{2\pi}$ of the whole circle. So the area is
    approximately $r
    \Delta r \Delta \theta$.

    Now, for fixed $\theta$, we can add up all the coordinate patches
    between $\theta$ and $\theta + \Delta \theta$, and this sum of
    areas is approximately equal to the product of 
    $\Delta \theta$ and the integral
    \[
      \int_0^{1+\cos \theta} r \, {\d}r.

  Adding up these areas over all $\theta$ from $0$ to $2\pi$, we
  get
  \[
    \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{1+\cos \theta} r \, \d r \, \d\theta =
    \int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{2}(1+\cos \theta)^2 \, \d\theta
    =  \boxed{\frac{3\pi}{2}}. 
  \]
  
  
  (ii) We can find this integral using the same procedure as above,
  except that at the step where we calculate the area of a patch, we
  also need to multiply it by the value of the function at some point
  in the patch. Since our function is defined in terms of $x$ and
  $y$, we need to substitute $x = r\cos \theta$ and $y = r\sin
  \theta$ to discover the value of $f$ at the point whose polar
  coordinates are $(r,\theta)$. So we get
  \sidenote{\href{https://cocalc.com/projects/7925f475-a0bd-4621-b78a-466c24c7863c/files/polar_integral.ipynb}{\cocalc} This one is tedious if done by
    hand, so we use computer algebra assistance}
  \[
    \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{1+\cos \theta} (r \cos\theta + r\sin
    \theta)r \, {\d}r \, \d\theta = \boxed{\frac{5\pi}{4}}. 
  \]
\end{solution}

We can see from this example that the ideas for setting up an iterated
polar integral are similar to those for 
rectangular integration:
\begin{obs}{Iterated polar integration}{iteratedpolar}
  To write the integral of a function $f$ on a region $D$ in $\R^2$
  as a double iterated integral, we may 
  \begin{enumerate}[(i), itemsep = 6pt, topsep = 5pt, leftmargin=12pt]
  \item find the least and greatest values of $\theta$ for any point in
    the region of integration, 
  \item for each fixed value of $\theta$, find the least and greatest
    values of $r$ for any point which is in $D$ and on the ray of angle
    $\theta$, 
  \item include the area differential* $\d A = r \, {\d}r \,
    \d\theta$, and 
  \item plug $x = r \cos\theta$ and $y=r\sin \theta$ into $f$, 
    that your integrand varies appropriately as $r$ and $\theta$ vary 
    \sidenote{* Don't forget the extra factor of $r$ in the polar area
      differential!}[-1cm]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{obs}

This same basic idea can be carried out in cylindrical and spherical
coordinates. The ingredients we need are (i) the volume differential
$\d V$ expressed in terms of cylindrical and spherical coordinates, and
(ii) the formulas for $x, y, z$ in terms of $r, \theta, z$ and in
terms of $\rho, \theta, \phi$. This information is listed in
Appendix~\ref{sec:polarref}. The only surprising entry in the tables
of that appendix is the spherical coordinate volume differential $\d V =
\rho^2 \sin \phi \, {\d}\rho \, {\d} \phi \, \d\theta$.

\begin{example}{Spherical coordinate volume differential}{voldiff}
  Explain why the volume differential in spherical coordinates is $\d V =
  \rho^2 \sin \phi \, {\d}\rho \, {\d} \phi \, \d\theta$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth} \parskip = 0.2 in The volume
    differential arises from slicing up the region of integration into
    small coordinate ``patches'', each of which consists of those
    points whose three spherical coordinates lie in the intervals*
    $[\rho, \rho+\Delta \rho]$, $[\theta, \theta+\Delta \theta]$, and
    $[\phi, \phi+\Delta \phi]$, respectively (see the top figure,
    where a wedge has been decomposed into spherical coordinate
    patches). Thus we must calculate the approximate volume of one
    such patch. \sidenote{* Here $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$ are the
      spherical coordinates of one of the corners of the patch}

    When $\Delta \rho$, $\Delta \theta$, and $\Delta \phi$ are all
    very small, the coordinate patch is approximately a rectangular
    prism. The dimensions of this rectangular prism, as marked in the
    lower figure, are $\Delta \rho$, $\rho\, \Delta \phi$, and
    $\rho \sin \phi \, \Delta \theta$.

    To see why the top edge length is $\rho \sin \phi \Delta \theta$,
    note that the dashed circle in the figure has radius
    $\rho \sin \phi$, since the \textit{cylindrical} radial coordinate
    $r$ satisfies the equation $r = \rho \sin \phi$. Thus the volume

  Consider a solid whose density at each point $(x,y,z)$ is
  $\delta(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ and which occupies the region
  enclosed by the cone $z = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and the plane $z = 1$.
  Find the mass of the solid. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}{0.65\textwidth}
    Let's set up the iterated integral with the order
    $d\rho\, {\d}\phi\, \d\theta$. The solid has points with $\theta$
    values as small as $0$ and as large as $2\pi$, so the outer limits
    will be $0$ and $2\pi$.

    For any given value of $\theta$, there are points with that
    $\theta$ value whose $\phi$ value is as small as zero (for the
    points on the positive $z$-axis) and as large as $\tfrac{\pi}{4}$
    (for the points on the cone $z = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$). So the middle
    limits are $0$ and $\tfrac{\pi}{4}$.

    Finally, for any given $\phi$ and $\theta$, the solid contains
    points with $z$ as small as 0 and as large as
    $\frac{1}{\cos \phi}$ (by right-triangle trigonometry; see
    figure).

\section{Integration in custom coordinates} \label{sec:changeofvariables}

\milink{double_integral_change_variables_introduction}{change of variables}

Sometimes we want to integrate a function over a region which is not
conveniently described using any of the standard coordinate
systems. In this section we will develop a general program for
integrating with respect to a custom-tailored coordinate system.

\begin{example}{}{change_of_variables}
  Find $\iint_D y^2 \, {\d}A$, where $D$ is the region in the first
  quadrant bounded by the lines
  through the origin of slope $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $2$, as well as the
  hyperbolas $xy = 1$ and $xy = 3$.

  Looking at the shape of the region (in the axes on the right above),
  it makes sense to slice it up along lines of the form $y = ux$ where $u$
  ranges over equally spaced values between $\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $2$,
  and along hyperbolas of the form $xy = v$ where $v$ ranges over
  $[1,3]$.

  Note that each point $(x,y)$ in $D$ can be identified by its $u$ and
  $v$ values.* In other words, $u$ and $v$ provide a coordinate system
  for the first quadrant. We can represent the relationship between
  $(u,v)$ and $(x,y)$ as a transformation $T$ that maps each $(u,v)$
  pair to its corresponding $(x,y)$ pair, as shown in the figure. If
  we want to find a formula for this map, we can solve the system
  $y = ux$ and $xy = v$ for $x$ and $y$ to find that $y = \sqrt{uv}$
  and $x = \sqrt{v/u}$.  \sidenote{* These specify, respectively,
    which line through the origin and which ``$xy=\text{constant}$''
    hyperbola the point is on}[-15mm]

  Now, to integrate $f(x,y) = y^2$ over $D$, we want to find the area
  of each of the small pieces we sliced $D$ into, multiply each such
  area by the value of $f$ somewhere on the piece, and sum the
  resulting products. Each patch is the image under $T$ of a rectangle
  of the form $[u, u+\Delta u] \times [v, v + \Delta v]$. The area of
  this rectangle is $\Delta u \Delta v$, and the transformation
  distorts its area by an amount that we can approximate by treating
  the transformation as linear around $(u,v)$ and using the fact that
  area distortion is measured by the determinant. Writing
  $T(u,v) = (\sqrt{v/u}, \sqrt{uv}) = (g(u,v), h(u,v))$, we linearly
  approximate $g$ at a point $(u,v)$ as the function $L_g$ defined by
  \[
    L_g(\widetilde{u},\widetilde{v}) = g(u,v) + \partial_ug(u,v)(\widetilde{u} -
    u)+ \partial_vg(u,v)(\widetilde{v} -v), 
  \]
  and similarly for the linear approximation $L_h$ of $h$. Thus for
  small $\Delta u$ and $\Delta v$, $T$ behaves like  
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:Tuv} 
    T(u + \Delta u, v + \Delta v) \approx T(u,v) + \big( \partial_ug(u,v)
    \Delta u + \partial_v g(u,v) \Delta v, \partial_uh(u,v)
    \Delta u + \partial_v h(u,v) \Delta v \big). 
  \end{equation}
  So the area of the image of
  $[u, u+\Delta u] \times [v, v + \Delta v]$ under $T$ is
  approximately* \sidenote{* The four entries of the matrix below come
    from the coefficients of $\Delta u$ and $\Delta v$ in
    \eqref{eq:Tuv}, or equivalently from the coefficients of
    $\widetilde{u}$ and $\widetilde{v}$ in $L_g$ and $L_h$}[-1cm]
  \[
    \left| \det \left[
        \begin{array}{cc}
          \partial_u g & \partial _v g\\
          \partial_u h & \partial _v h 
        \end{array} \right]
    \right|\Delta u \Delta v,  =

        \end{array} \right]
    \right| \Delta u \Delta v  = \frac{1}{2u}
    \Delta u \Delta v. 
  \]
  So the contribution of each piece to the value of the integral is
  $uv \frac{1}{2u} \Delta u \, {\Delta}v$. Then summing and taking
  $(\Delta u, \Delta v) \to (0,0)$ yields
  $\displaystyle{\int_{1}^{3}\int_{1/2}^{2}uv \frac{1}{2u} \d u \,
    {\d}v = \boxed{3}}$.

The matrix $\left[
  \begin{array}{cc}
    \partial_u g & \partial _v g \\
    \partial_u h & \partial _v h
  \end{array} \right]$ is called the \textit{Jacobian matrix}, and
its determinant is called the \textit{Jacobian determinant}. Often we just say
``Jacobian'', relying on context to distinguish. It can be written
as $\left|\frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} \right|$ for
short.* \sidenote{* Note that in this new notation, the symbols
  $g$ and $h$ are replaced by $x$ and $y$. Thus we are abusing notation by
  regarding $x$ and $y$ as functions of $u$ and $v$, even though
  they also represent independent variables}[-1cm]

The following theorem summarizes the technique we developed in
Example~\ref{exam:change_of_variables}. 

\begin{theo}{Multivariable change of variables}{change_of_variables}
  Suppose that $T: \R^2 \to \R^2$ is a differentiable transformation
  that maps a region $R$ one-to-one onto a region $D$. Then for any
  continuous function $f$, we have 
  \[
    \iint_D f(x,y) \, \d x\, \d y = \iint_R f(T^{-1}(x,y)) \left|
      \frac{\partial (x,y)}{\partial (u,v)} \right| \, {\d}u \, {\d}v. 
  \]
\end{theo}

The biggest challenge in custom coordinate problems typically lies in
choosing suitable coordinates. The strategy of
Example~\ref{exam:change_of_variables} is pretty broadly useful: try
to express all boundary arcs of $D$ as level sets of at most two
functions of $x$ and $y$. These two functions* are good choices for
the coordinates $u$ and $v$. \sidenote{* If all the boundary arcs are
  level sets of a \textit{single} function $u$, then you'll have some
  flexibility in choosing the other; often $v=x$ or $v=y$ works}

\section{Applications of integration*} \label{sec:applications}

\subsection{Average value}

The most basic example of averaging is summing a list of numbers and
dividing by the number of entries in the list. While this concept is
usually used without reference to functions, one way to express it is
to say that the average of a function
$f:\{1,2,\ldots,n\} \rightarrow \R$ is defined to be
\begin{equation} \label{eq:avg} 
  \mathrm{average}(f) = \frac{f(1) + f(2) + \cdots + f(n)}{n}. 
\end{equation}
Now suppose that the domain of $f$ is a region $R\subset \R^n$. The
most natural way to adapt \eqref{eq:avg} to this setting is to replace
the sum in the numerator with an integral, and replace the ``size'' of
the domain $n$ in the denominator with the volume of $R$. We will
state the definition for a function defined on a region in $\R^3$:

\begin{defn}{Average value of a function over a solid}{avg}
  If $R\subset \R^3$ is a region and $f: R \to \R$, then the \textbf{average value} of $f$ is
  \[
    \mathrm{average}(f) = \frac{\displaystyle{\iiint_R f \,
        dV}}{\displaystyle{\iiint_R 1 \, dV}}.
  \]
\end{defn}

Let's explain the connection between Definition~\ref{defn:avg} and
\eqref{eq:avg} more carefully: intuitively, the average value of a
continuously varying function $f:R\to \R$ should be very close to the
result of overlaying $R$ with a fine grid, evaluating the function at
all the corners of the cells of that grid, and averaging the
results. By \eqref{eq:avg}, this latter average is equal to the
quotient* of (1) the sum of all the function's values at the grid
points and (2) the number of grid points. If we multiply numerator and
denominator of this quotient by the volume of a single small grid
cell, then the numerator becomes a Riemann sum approximating
$\iiint_R f \, dV$, and the denominator becomes a Riemann sum
approximating the volume $\iiint_R 1 \, dV$ of $R$. Therefore, the
limit of this quotient as the mesh of the grid tends to zero is equal
to the formula given in Definition~\ref{defn:avg}. \sidenote{* We're
  sticking with verbal descriptions of the quantities involved here to
  avoid the somewhat unwieldy notation associated with Riemann
  sums}[-2cm]

\begin{exercise}{}{} \parskip = 4pt
  (a) Find the average squared distance from the origin to a point in
  the unit sphere.

  (b) Find the average distance from the origin to a point in the unit
  sphere.

  (c) Is the square of the average distance equal to the average of
  the squared distance?
\end{exercise}

If we want some of the numbers being averaged to count more than
others, we can replace \eqref{eq:avg} with a \textbf{weighted
  average}. If $f:\{1,2,\ldots,n\} \rightarrow \R$ and
$w:\{1,2,\ldots,n\} \rightarrow \R$, then the $w$-weighted average of
$f$ is defined to be
\begin{equation} \label{eq:wavg} \mathrm{average}_w(f) =
  \frac{f(1)w(1) + f(2)w(2) + \cdots + f(n)w(n)}{w(1)+w(2) \cdots +
    w(n)}.
\end{equation}
For example, if your scores on 3 exams are $f(1)=90, f(2)=90$,
$f(3)=100$ with weights $w(1)=30$, $w(2)=30$, $w(3)=40$, then your
weighted average is
$\rule[-12pt]{0pt}{24pt}\tfrac{\rule[-2pt]{0pt}{12pt} 90\cdot 30 \,+\,
  90\cdot 30 \,+\, 100 \cdot 40}{\rule{0pt}{6pt} 30\,+\,30\,+\,40} = 94$. We
can adapt \eqref{eq:wavg} for continuously varying functions over a
domain in $\R^3$ as we did in Definition~\ref{defn:avg}. 

\begin{defn}{Weighted average of a function over a solid}{wavg}
  If $R\subset \R^3$ is a region, and that $f : R \to \R$ and
  $w : R \to [0,\infty)$ are functions. Then the \textbf{$w$-weighted
    average} of $f$ is
  \[
    \mathrm{average}_w(f) = \frac{\displaystyle{\iiint_R f w\,
        dV}}{\displaystyle{\iiint_R w \, dV}}.
  \]
\end{defn}

\subsection{Center of mass}

The center of mass of a physical rod is the point along the length of
the rod where it balances. The center of mass of a rod with constant
mass density is the point halfway between the rod's ends. But what if
the rod has a varying mass density?

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/centerofmass}
  \caption{A rod with mass density indicated by color}
  \label{fig:rod} 
\end{figure}

\sidenote{* See Section \ref{sec:moments-inertia} for more discussion
  on torque}[1mm] Clearly the rod in Figure~\ref{fig:rod} will tip to
the right if we support it in the middle. To find its center of mass,
recall from physics that \textit{torque}* applied by a force to an
object rotating about a fixed pivot is equal to the product of the
force applied* and the distance to the pivot. The rod is balanced if
the torque applied by gravity on the two sides is equal. If the rod is
situated along the interval $[a,b]$, has density
$\delta:[a,b] \to \R$, and is supported at the point $x_0$, then the
clockwise torque is equal to \sidenote{* Actually, we include only the
  component of the force in the direction perpendicular to the vector
  from the pivot to the point where the force is being applied}[-6mm]
\[
  \overbrace{g}^{\text{gravitational acceleration}}\int_{x_0}^b
  \overbrace{(x-x_0)}^{\text{length of moment arm}} \quad
  \underbrace{\overbrace{\delta(x)}^{\text{density of small piece
      }[x,\, x+\d x]} \quad \overbrace{\d x}^{\text{length of small
        piece}}}_{\text{mass of small piece}}.
\]
Similarly, the counterclockwise torque is 
\[
  g\int_{a}^{x_0} (x_0-x)\delta(x) \, \d x. 
\]
Setting these two integrals equal and collecting terms we get 
\[
  0 = \int_{x_0}^{b} (x-x_0)\delta(x) \, \d x + \int_{a}^{x_0} (x-x_0)\delta(x) \, \d x =
  \int_{a}^{b} (x-x_0)\delta(x) \, \d x. 
\]
Now we can distribute the $\delta(x)$ factor, apply linearity of the
integral, and solve for $x_0$ to find
\[
  x_0 = \frac{\displaystyle{\int_a^b x \delta(x) \, \d x}}{\displaystyle{\int_a^b \delta(x) \, \d x}}. 
\]
In other words, the location of the center of mass is equal to
\textbf{the density-weighted average value of the coordinate function
  $\bm{x}$}.

We can apply the same idea (one axis at a time) to a \textbf{lamina},
which is a plate* occupying a region $L\subset \R^2$ and having mass
density $\sigma:L \to [0,\infty)$. And similarly for a solid in $\R^3$
with a mass density function $\delta$. In all cases, the coordinates
of the center of mass are equal to the density-weighted averages of
the corresponding coordinate functions: \sidenote{* By slight abuse of
  notation, we may use $L$ to refer to either the lamina or the region
  in $\R^2$ that it occupies}[-5mm]

\begin{defn}{Center of mass}{COM}
  The {center of mass} of a lamina $L$ with mass density $\sigma:L \to [0,\infty)$ is
  \[
    \left(
      \frac{\displaystyle{\iint_L x \, \sigma(x,y) \, \d x \, \d y}}
      {\displaystyle{\iint_L \sigma(x,y) \, \d x \, \d y}},
      \frac{\displaystyle{\iint_L y \, \sigma(x,y) \, \d x \, \d y}}
      {\displaystyle{\iint_L \sigma(x,y) \, \d x \, \d y}}
    \right). 
  \]
  The center of mass of a solid occupying a region $R$ with mass
  density $\delta:R \to [0,\infty)$ is
  \[
    \left(
      \frac{\displaystyle{\iiint_R x \, \delta(x,y,z) \, \d x \, \d y \, \d z}}

      {\displaystyle{\iiint_R \delta(x,y,z) \, \d x \, \d y \, \d z}}
    \right). 
  \]

    =\frac{k/6}{k/2} = \frac{1}{3}.
  \]

\subsection{Moments of inertia} \label{sec:moments-inertia}

Newton's second law says that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:newton2nd} 
  \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{F}$, $m$, and $\mathbf{a}$ are the net force acting
upon a particle, its mass, and its resulting acceleration,
respectively. The rotational analogue of Newton's second law says
that, for any line $\ell$ in space,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:newton2nd_rot} 
  {\bm \tau} = I {\bm \alpha}, 
\end{equation}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.7\textwidth}
  where $\tau$ is the torque about $\ell$ being applied to the
  particle, $I$ is the particle's \textbf{moment of inertia} about
  $\ell$, and ${\bm \alpha}$ is the angular acceleration of the
  particle about $\ell$. Thus the moment of inertia is the rotational
  analogue of mass.
  
  Let's derive \eqref{eq:newton2nd_rot} from \eqref{eq:newton2nd} as
  context for providing mathematical definitions for the quantities in
  \eqref{eq:newton2nd_rot}. Denote by $\mathbf{r}$ the vector from the
  nearest point on $\ell$ to the location of the particle. Then
  crossing $\mathbf{r}$ with both sides of \eqref{eq:newton2nd}, we
  find that
  \[
    \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{a}. 
  \]
  We define the torque about $\ell$ to be ${\bm \tau} \colonequals
  \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}$. Letting $r = |\mathbf{r}|$ be the
  distance from $\ell$ to the particle, we define the angular
  acceleration of the particle about $\ell$ to be ${\bm \alpha} =
  \frac{\mathbf{r}}{r} \times \frac{\mathbf{a}}{r}$. Then we obtain
  \eqref{eq:newton2nd_rot} with $I = mr^2$.

Moment of inertia, like mass, is additive. That is, the moment of
inertia of an ensemble of particles about a line $\ell$ is equal to
the sum of the moments of inertia about $\ell$ of the
particles. Therefore, the moment of inertia of a solid with
continuously varying mass density may be approximated by subdividing
the solid into small pieces and approximating the moment of inertia of
each piece as its mass times the squared distance from some point in
the small piece to $\ell$. Summing the results and taking the size of
the pieces to zero leads to the following formula:
\begin{defn}{Moment of inertia}{MOI}
  The moment of inertia about a line $\ell$ of a solid occupying a
  region $R\subset \R^3$ and having density $\delta: \R^3 \to [0,\infty)$ is 
  \[
    I = \iiint_{R} r(x,y,z)^2 \, \delta(x,y,z) \, \d x \, \d y\, \d z,

\subsection{Probability}

A dart thrown at a dartboard $D\subset \R^2$ strikes a \textit{random}
point $P$ in $D$. We model this state of affairs by describing a
\textbf{probability density function}* $f:D \to [0,\infty)$ with the
property that the probability that $P$ lies in any region $A$ given by
integrating $f$ over $A$. \sidenote{* or pdf, for short}

    the probability density function for the random point where your

\begin{solution} 
  The region in question is described most easily in polar
  coordinates: it is the set of points whose polar coordinates
  $(r,\theta)$ satisfy $\ri \leq r \leq \ro$ and*
  $81^\circ \leq \theta \leq 99^\circ$, where $\ri = 3.85$ and
  $\ro = 4.2$. \sidenote{* Note that the width of each sector is
    $360^\circ/20 = 18^\circ$, so the angles of the rays bounding the
    sector labeled 20 are $90^\circ \pm \tfrac{18^\circ}{2}$}

  Therefore, we can obtain the probability of hitting the triple 20 by
  expressing the density function in polar coordinates and integrating
  \[
    \int_{9\pi/20}^{11\pi/20} \int_{\ri}^{\ro}
    \frac{1}{{\pi}}\e^{-r^2} r \, \d r \, \d\theta =
    \left(\frac{\pi}{10}\right) \left(\frac{1}{{\pi}}\right)
    \left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\e^{-\ro^2}-\left(-\tfrac{1}{2}\e^{-\ri^2}\right)\right).
  \]
  Substituting the given values of $\ro$ and $\ri$ yields a
  probability of approximately $\boxed{1.717\times10^{-8}}$ of scoring
  60 on a single throw.
\end{solution}

The integral of a probability density function over its whole domain
must be equal to 1, since that is the probability that the random
point $P$ is \textit{somewhere} in $D$. 

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Verify that $f(x,y) = \frac{1}{\pi} \e^{-x^2 - y^2}$ defined on
  $\R^2$ is a valid probability density function (that is, integrating
  it over its domain yields the value 1).
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{pdfover1}
  Suppose that $f$ is a probability density function for a random
  point $P$ in a domain $D\subset \R^2$. Is it possible that there
  exists a point $(x,y) \in D$ such that $f(x,y) = 100$? Explain why
  or why not. (Hint: is it possible for a solid whose total mass is 1
  kilogram to have a density of 100 kilograms per cubic centimeter at
  a particular point in the solid?)
\end{exercise}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.55\textwidth} \parskip = 12pt 
  The analogy between probability density and mass density suggested
  in Exercise~\ref{exer:pdfover1} is a broadly useful conceptual tool:
  you can imagine probability as some kind of abstract dust lying around
  on $D$, and regions which contain more of it are more likely to
  include $P$. To figure out exactly how much is in a given region, we
  integrate over that region. 

  \begin{exercise}{}{}
    Explain why the answer found in Example~\ref{exam:triple20} was

    actually good enough that the pdf given in that problem describes
    your accuracy well, where should you consider aiming?

\end{minipage}

Given a function $g:D \to \R$, the value of $g(P)$ depends on the
value of $P$ and is therefore random. We call $g(P)$ a \textbf{random
  variable} and define its \textbf{expected value} to be the
probability-weighted integral of $g$.

\begin{example}{}{avgdist}
  Find the average distance from the origin to a point $P$ selected
  uniformly at random from the triangle $T$ with vertices at $(0,0)$, $(1,0)$,
  and $(1,1)$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The word ``uniform'' means that $P$'s pdf is a constant function. To
  determine the value of this constant, we use the fact that the pdf
  integrates to 1. If $f(x,y) = k$ for all $(x,y) \in T$, then
  \[
    \iint_T k \, \d A = k\, \mathrm{area}(T) = 1, 
  \]
  which implies that $k=2$. We are calculating the expected
  value of $g(P)$, where $g(x,y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. So the expected
  value of $g(P)$ is given by $\iint_T g \, 2\,\d A$. Because the
  integrand is conveniently expressed in polar coordinates, we
  represent $T$ in polar coordinates as the set of points where
  $\theta$ is between $0$ and $\pi/4$ and where $r$ is between 0
  and $\sec \theta$. Then we have
  \[
    \iint_T g \, 2\, \d A = \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \int_0^{\sec \theta} r
    \, 2\, r \, \d r\, \d\theta = \frac{2}{3} \int_{0}^{\pi/4} \sec^3
    \theta \, \d\theta. 
  \]
  We can use integration by parts to work out
  $\int \sec^3 \theta \, \d \theta = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sec \theta \tan
    \theta + \ln|\sec\theta + \tan \theta|\right)$.
  Substitution yields an expected value of
  \[
    \boxed{\frac{1}{3}\left(\sqrt{2} +
        \ln\left({\sqrt{2}+1}\right)\right) \approx
      0.765}\,.
  \]
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Explain why the answer to Example~\ref{exam:avgdist} is also the
  average distance from the origin to a point selected uniformly at
  random from the unit square $[0,1]^2$. 
\end{exercise}

\begin{example}{}{} \parskip = 8pt Find the expected value of the
  latitude (as measured from the north pole) of a point chosen
  uniformly at random from the upper half of the earth (the part above
  the plane passing through the equator). (Model the earth as a
  sphere.)
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The answer doesn't change if we change the radius of the sphere, so
  we might as well choose unit radius. The pdf is some constant $k$,
  and the probability of the randomly selected point lying somewhere
  in the upper half ball $H$ is
  \[
    \int_H k \, \d V = k\, \mathrm{vol}(H) = \frac{2\pi k}{3}. 
  \]
  Since the pdf must integrate to 1, we have $k =
  \tfrac{3}{2\pi}$.

  Now the function on $H$ that we want to calculate the expected value
  of is the coordinate function $\phi$. So we have
  \[
    \int_H k\phi \, \d V = \frac{3}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} \int
    _0^{\pi/2}\int_{0}^{1} \phi \rho^2 \sin \phi \, \d \rho \, \d \phi
    \, \d \theta = 1, 
  \]
  where we've used the integration-by-parts side-problem
  $\displaystyle{\int_0^{\pi/2} \phi \sin \phi \, \d \phi =
    1}$. Therefore, the expected value of the latitude is
  $\boxed{1 \text{ radian}}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Find the expected value of $g(P)$ where $g(x,y) = xy$ and $P$ is a
  random point in $[0,1]^2$ whose pdf is given by $f(x,y) = xy(1-x)(1-y)$.

  your friend scores higher than you on the exam?*

So far we have been considering functions from $\R^n$ to $\R^1$ (where
$n$ is $2$ or $3$). In this chapter we work with functions from $\R^n$
to $\R^2$ or $\R^3$. How should such functions be visualized? Let's
begin by considering how they arise in applications.

\sidenote{* Many other physical phenomena, such as electromagnetic
  forces, heat flow, fluid flow are modeled as vector fields} To
describe the gravitational force* felt by a particle, we would use a
function with a three-dimensional input (to specify the particle's
location) as well as a three-dimensional output, to specify the
direction and magnitude of the force. It is natural to represent this
function by drawing a small arrow indicating the output vector at
several points in space, because this makes it easy to imagine how the
force changes as the particle moves around (see
Figure~\ref{fig:gravity}).

This picture suggests the term \textbf{vector field} for a function
from $\R^n$ to $\R^n$, where $n > 1$. The gravitational vector field
plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:gravity} is
\begin{equation} \label{eq:gravity} 
  \mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = -\frac{GMm}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}}\left\langle x-1, y-1, z-1
  \right\rangle. 
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant and $Mm$ is the product of
the masses of particle and the attracting body at $(1,1,1)$.

\milink{line_integral_vector_field_introduction}{line integrals}
Now suppose that rather than remaining stationary, our particle moves
along a path in the presence of a force field (see
Figure~\ref{fig:trigvectorfield}).* Sometimes the particle is moving
with the force field and getting a boost from it, whereas other times
it's working against the force field. How much net work does it take
to move along the path? \sidenote{* A
  vector field in which the vectors represent a physical force}[-1cm]

If the force field were constant and the path were straight, then
physics tells us tha work is equal to the product of the magnitude $F$
of the force, the distance $d$ traveled, and the cosine of the angle
$\theta$ between the force and the path. Alternatively, we may
interpret the force and distance as vectors $\mathbf{F}$ and
$\mathbf{d}$ and write the work as a dot product:
\[
  W = F d \cos \theta = \mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{d}. 
\]

\begin{wrapfigure}[19]{O}[1cm]{6cm}
  \begin{asy}
    import graph;
    size(6cm);
    
    pair a=(0,0);
    pair b=(2pi,2pi);
    
    path vector(pair z) {return (0,0)--(sin(z.x),cos(z.y));}

  \caption{The path of a particle moving through a vector field\label{fig:trigvectorfield}}
\end{wrapfigure}

So how do we bootstrap our way from constant force and a straight path
to varying force and a curvy path? We can cut up the path into small
pieces, handle each small piece by treating the force as approximately
constant and the path as approximately straight, and then add up
the amount of work for each small piece. We will assume that our path
$\mathbf{r}(t)$ is differentiable.* \sidenote{* The curve could
  alternatively be \textit{piecewise} differentiable, meaning that the
  curve is non-differentiable at only finitely many points}[-1cm]

Suppose we have a path $C$ parameterized as $\mathbf{r}(t)$ where $t$
ranges from $a$ to $b$. Over the time interval $[t,t+\Delta t]$, the
particle is displaced by* the vector $\mathbf{r}'(t) \, \Delta t$, and
the force it feels over that time is* $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t))$.
Therefore, the contribution from the time period $[t, t+\Delta t]$ is
equal to \sidenote{* * Approximately, with an error that vanishes as
  $\Delta t \to 0$}
\[
  \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, \Delta t. 
\]
Summing all these contributions and taking $\Delta t \to 0$, we arrive
at the formula
\[
  W = \int_a^b \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(t)) \cdot \mathbf{r}'(t) \, {\d}t =
  \int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \d\mathbf{r}, 
\]
where the last expression is an abbreviation for the middle
expression. We call an integral of the form $\displaystyle{\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot
  \d\mathbf{r}}$ a \textbf{line integral}. 

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the line integral of $\mathbf{F}(x,y) = \langle xy, y \rangle$
  along the parabola $y = x^2$ from 
  $(0,0)$ to $(2,4)$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Let's parameterize the parabola using the $x$-coordinate as the
  parameter:
  \[
    \mathbf{r}(t) = \langle t, t^2 \rangle. 
  \]
  Note that the point $(2,4)$ is visited at time $t=2$, while the
  origin is visited at time $t=0$. Therefore, 
  \[
    W = \int_0^2 \langle t(t^2), t^2 \rangle \cdot \langle 1, 2t \rangle
    \, {\d}t = \int_0^2 (t^3 + 2t^3) \, {\d}t = \boxed{12}. 
  \]
\end{solution}

The following theorem states that the choice of parameterization of a
curve doesn't matter when computing a line integral. This makes sense
physically, since the formula $W = Fd$ does not involve time, and our
derivation of the line integral formula was based on $W=Fd$. The role
of the parameterization was merely to provide a convenient way to
split up the path into short pieces. Exercise~\ref{exer:IOP} below
gives an example.

\begin{theo}{Independence of parameterization}{IOP}
  If $C$ is a curve parameterized by $\mathbf{r}_1$ over $[a,b]$ and
  also by $\mathbf{r}_2$ over $[c,d]$, then
  \[
    \int_a^b\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}_1(t))  \cdot \,
    \mathbf{r}'_1(t) \, {\d}t =
    \int_c^d \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}_2(t))  \cdot \,
    \mathbf{r}'_2(t) \, {\d}t. 
  \]
  In other words,
  $\displaystyle{\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot \d\mathbf{r}}$ depends only
  on the curve $C$, not the choice of parameterization.

  \caption{The vector field $\mathbf{F}(x,y) = \langle -y,x \rangle$
    and two semicircular paths\label{fig:swirl}}
\end{wrapfigure}

In general, the line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ over a path between two
points depends on the path, not just the starting and ending points.
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:swirl}, the line integral along the
blue (top) path is positive, while the line integral along the orange
(bottom) path is negative.

However, there is an important class of vector fields which are
path-independent, meaning that the value of $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot
\d\mathbf{r}$ depends only on the starting and ending points of $C$.
These are the vector fields which can be written as the gradient of a
function from $\R^n$ to $\R^1$. For example, $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z) =
\langle -2x, -2y, z \rangle$ is the gradient of the function
\[
  f(x,y,z) = -x^2-y^2 + \tfrac{1}{2}z^2. 
\]
Such vector fields are called \textbf{conservative}. 

If we calculate the line integral of $\nabla f$ along a curve $C$
parameterized by $\mathbf{r}(t) = \langle r_1(t), r_2(t), r_3(t) \rangle$,
then the contribution from the portion of the curve from
$\mathbf{r}(t)$ to $\mathbf{r}(t+\Delta t)$ is*
\sidenote{* approximately, with an error that vanishes as  $\Delta t
  \to 0$}[1cm]
\[
  \langle \partial_x f, \partial_y f, \partial_z f \rangle \cdot
  \langle r_1'(t), r_2'(t), r_3'(t) \rangle \, \Delta t, 
\]
which by the chain rule is* the change in $f(\mathbf{r}(t))$ over that
interval. Therefore, the line integral of $\nabla f$ along a path is
equal to the change in $f$ from the beginning to the end of the path.

\begin{theo}{Fundamental theorem for line integrals}{fund_theorem}
  If $C$ is a path from $\mathbf{a}$ to $\mathbf{b}$ and $f$ is a
  differentiable function, then 
  \[
    \int_C \nabla f \cdot \, {\d}\mathbf{r} = f(\mathbf{b}) - f(\mathbf{a}). 
  \]
\end{theo}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Suppose $\mathbf{F}(x,y,z) = \langle 2  x y^{3} z, 3  x^{2} y^{2}
  z + y, x^{2} y^{3} \rangle$ and that $C$ is the circular arc from the
  origin to the point $(1,1,1)$ and passing through the point
  $(1/2,1/2,1)$. Find $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Finding a parameterization for $C$ seems computationally messy.
  However, if $\mathbf{F}$ is conservative, then we can use
  Theorem~\ref{th:fund_theorem}. Integrating $2  x y^{3} z$ with
  respect to $x$, we see that if $\mathbf{F} = \nabla f$ for some
  function $f$, then we would have 
  \[
    f(x,y,z) = x^2 y^3 z + C_1(y,z), 
  \]
  where $C_1(y,z)$ denotes a function not depending on $x$. Similarly,
  we can integrate the second and third components with respect to $y$
  and $z$ to find that
  \begin{align*}
    f(x,y,z) &= x^2 y^3 z + \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C_2(x,z) \\
    f(x,y,z) &= x^2 y^3 z + C_3(x,y). 
  \end{align*}
  We see that these three conditions are simultaneously satisfied by
  the function $f(x,y,z) = x^2 y^3 z + \tfrac{1}{2}y^2$. So the
  desired line integral is equal to 
  \[
    f(1,1,1) - f(0,0,0) = \frac{3}{2} - 0  = \boxed{\frac{3}{2}}. 
  \]
\end{solution}

The following theorem provides a convenient way to check whether a
two-dimensional vector field is conservative. 

\begin{theo}{}{conservativetest}
  A vector field $\mathbf{F}(x,y) = \langle M(x,y), N(x,y)\rangle$
  which is differentiable on* \sidenote{* Here it is important that
    $\mathbf{F}$ is differentiable on all of $\R^2$, rather than an
    arbitrary subset thereof---see Exercise~\ref{exer:uhoh}} $\R^2$ is
  conservative if and only if
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:DE}
    \partial_x N = \partial_y M. 
  \end{equation}
\end{theo}
To see where \eqref{eq:DE} comes from, note that this equation follows directly
from Clairaut's theorem for conservative fields $\mathbf{F}$. 
So the more interesting aspect of Theorem~\ref{th:conservativetest} is
the converse direction: merely checking $\partial_x N = \partial_y M$
establishes existence or nonexistence of a gradient function.

Is it possible to engineer a simple mechanical device that measures

surprising, since computing the area would seem to require some
inspection of the region inside the curve. However, the

region. The design of the planimeter takes advantage of the following

  This last integral can be done with a trick: note that

  However, the contributions of $\int_0^{2\pi} \cos^2 t\, {\d}t$ and
  $\int_0^{2\pi} \sin^2 t\, {\d}t$ are equal, since their graphs over the

\section{Surface integrals and flow} \label{sec:surf}

\subsection{Surface integrals}

\milink{surface_integral_scalar_function_introduction}{surface integrals}

What is the average temperature on the surface of the earth? Let's
look past the scientific challenges of this problem and imagine that
the earth is a sphere $S$ and that we have a reading of the
temperature $T$ at every point on its surface at a particular point in
time. The average temperature at that moment should then be the
integral of $T$ over $S$ divided by the surface area of $S$. But what
does it mean to integrate over a surface?

We can use the same approach we use throughout calculus when studying
quantities which are additive and continuously varying: split $S$ into
tiny patches over which $T$ may be treated as constant, multiply the
area of each patch by the value of $T$ somewhere on that patch, and
sum the resulting products. As the size of the patches tends to zero,
we expect this sum to converge to some limiting value, and we can
declare that limit to be the value of the \textbf{surface integral}*
of $f$ over $S$, denoted $\iint_S f \, {\d}A$. \sidenote{* Or scalar
  surface integral, to distinguish from vector surface integral
  introduced in the next subsection}[5mm]

\begin{example}{}{surf}
  Find the surface integral of $f(x,y,z) = 2x^2 +2y^2 + 2z^2$ over the
  unit sphere $S$. You may assume that the surface area of a sphere of
  radius $R$ is $4\pi R^2$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  This function is equal to 2 everywhere on the unit sphere, so if we
  split $S$ into many small pieces and consider one of them, then the
  product of the value of $f$ somewhere on the piece and the area of
  the piece is just twice the area of the piece. When we sum these
  contributions over all the pieces, we will end up with twice the
  total surface area of the sphere. In other words, we have
  \[
    \iint_{S} 2 \,\d A =     2 \iint_{S} 1 \,\d A = 2 \times \text{surface
      area}(S) = 8\pi. 
  \]
\end{solution}

Example~\ref{exam:surf} was special because the function happened to
be constant over the surface. Another special situation which
simplifies the process of finding a surface integral is when
we're integrating over a surface which is contained in a plane. 

\begin{example}{}{xyz}
  Find the surface integral of $f(x,y,z) = xyz$ over the rectangular
  prism $[0,1] \times [0,2] \times [0,3]$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  The value of the function $f$ at every point in a coordinate plane
  is zero. So the contribution from these faces is zero.

  For the top face, the value of the function at each point $(x,y,3)$
  is $3xy$. Therefore, the integral of $f$ over this face is what you
  get when you split the rectangle $[0,1] \times [0,2]$ into many
  small rectangles, multiply the value of $3xy$ by the area of each
  one (where $x$ and $y$ are the first and second coordinates of some
  point in the small rectangle), sum the results, and take the
  rectangle size to zero. In other words, the contribution from the
  top face is
  \[
    \int_0^1 \int_0^2 3xy \, \d y\, \d x = 3. 
  \]
  Likewise, the contributions from the other two faces are
  \begin{align*}
    \int_0^3 \int_0^2 1yz \, \d y\, \d z &= 9, \text{ and} \\
    \int_{0}^{3}
    \int_{0}^{1}2xz \, \d x\,
    \d z &= \frac{9}{2}
  \end{align*}
  So altogether the surface integral is equal to $\displaystyle{3 + 9 +
    \frac{9}{2}} = \boxed{\frac{33}{2}}$. 
\end{solution}

Let's develop a general-purpose method for evaluating surface
integrals. Recall that a parameterization of a curve $C$ in $\R^3$ is
a function $\mathbf{r}: [a,b] \to \R^3$ for which $\mathbf{r}(t)$
traces out the points of $C$ as $t$ goes from $a$ to $b$. Likewise, a
\textbf{parameterization} of a surface $S$ in $\R^3$ is a function
$\mathbf{r}$ from some planar domain $D \subset \R^2$ to $\R^3$ such
that $\mathbf{r}(u,v)$ sweeps out* \sidenote{* More precisely, a
  parameterization $\mathbf{r}$ is a bijective map from $D$ to $S$} the
surface $S$ as $(u,v)$ varies over $D$.

\begin{example}{}{paramribbon}
  Find a parameterization of the surface consisting of the points
  $(x,y,z) \in \R^3$ such that $y = \sin 7z$, $0 \leq x \leq 1$, and
  $0 \leq z \leq \frac{\pi}{2}$. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  One way to map a pair of points $(u,v)$ to a triple of points
  $(x,y,z)$ satisfying the given equations is to use $u = z$ and $v = x$ as
  our two parameters. Then $\mathbf{r}(u,v) = (v,\sin(7u),u)$ maps the
  rectangle $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}] \times [0,1]$ to the desired surface,
  as shown.

\begin{example}{}{paramsphere}
  Find a parameterization of the portion of the unit sphere in the

\begin{solution}
  A parameterization is a way of using two numbers to identify points
  on the surface. We have a standard way of doing this on the sphere
  we live on: latitude and longitude. So we can parametrize a sphere
  or a portion thereof by using $\theta$ and $\phi$ as
  parameters.* \sidenote{* We could define $u = \theta$ and
    $v = \phi$, but since we already have standard names for these
    parameters, we'll just switch to using $\theta$ and $\phi$ instead
    of $u$ and $v$} As we discovered in Exercise~\ref{exer:spherical},
  the point on the sphere with spherical coordinates $1$, $\theta$,
  and $\phi$ is
  \[
    \mathbf{r}(\theta,\phi) =
    (\cos\theta\sin\phi,\sin\theta\sin\phi,\cos\phi). 
  \]
  This function $\mathbf{r}$ maps $[0,\frac{\pi}{2}] \times
  [0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$ onto the portion of the sphere in the first
  octant:

The lesson of Examples~\ref{exam:paramribbon} and
\ref{exam:paramsphere} is that \textbf{coordinates make good
  parameters}. It might be convenient to use Cartesian coordinates,
cylindrical or spherical coordinates, or even custom coordinates. But
if we find two coordinate functions whose values conveniently specify
a location $(x,y,z)$ on the surface, then we can define $\mathbf{r}$
to be the map which sends each pair of coordinate values to the triple
$(x,y,z)$.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i),itemsep=0pt,leftmargin=12pt]
  \item  Parametrize the portion of the plane $x + 2y + 3z = 6$ in the first
    octant. 
  \item  Sketch and parametrize the set of points $(x,y,z)$ satisfying $0 \leq z
    \leq x$ and $x^2 +
    y^2 = 1$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

If we can parametrize a surface, then we can split $S$ into many small
pieces by splitting $D$ into many small rectangles. Each small
rectangle $[u,u+\Delta u] \times [v,v+\Delta v]$ maps under the
parameterization to an approximate parallelogram spanned by
\[
  \mathbf{r}(u+\Delta u, v) - \mathbf{r}(u,v) \approx \partial_u
  \mathbf{r}(u,v) \Delta u  \quad \text{ and } \quad 
  \mathbf{r}(u, v+\Delta v) - \mathbf{r}(u,v) \approx
  \partial_v
  \mathbf{r}(u,v) \Delta v. 
\]
The area spanned by this small parallelogram is the cross product of
these two vectors. Multiplying this area by the value of $f$ somewhere
in the parallelogram and summing over all the tiny rectangles, we get
the following theorem.
\begin{theo}{(Surface integral formula)}{surfformula}
  If $\mathbf{r}:D \to \R^3$ is a parameterization of a surface $S$, then
  \milink{parametrized_surface_introduction}{surface parameterization}
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:surfformula} 
    \iint_S f \, {\d}A = \iint_D f(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) |\partial_u
    \mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r}| \, {\d}u\,{\d}v. 
  \end{equation}
\end{theo}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the average value of the function $f(x,y,z) = z$ on the upper
  unit half-sphere. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Let's use the parametrization 
  \[
    \mathbf{r}(\theta,\phi) =
    (\cos\theta\sin\phi,\sin\theta\sin\phi,\cos\phi), 
  \]
  as $\theta$ ranges from 0 to $2\pi$ and $\phi$ ranges from $0$ to
  $\frac{\pi}{2}$. Then 
  \[
    |\partial_\theta\mathbf{r} \times     \partial_\phi\mathbf{r} |^2=
    \left(- \sin{\phi} \sin^{2}{\theta
      } \cos{\phi} - \sin{\phi}
      \cos{\phi} \cos^{2}{\theta}\right)^{2} + \sin^{4}{\phi} \sin^{2}{\theta } + \sin^{4}{\phi}
    \cos^{2}{\theta } = \sin^2\phi. 
  \]
  Theorem~\ref{th:surfformula} gives 
  \[
    \int_S z \, \d{A} = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
    \overbrace{(\cos\phi)}^{z} \overbrace{\sin\phi}^{|\partial_\theta
      \mathbf{r}\times \partial_\phi \mathbf{r}|} \, \d \phi \, \d
    \theta = \pi. 
  \]
  The surface area of the upper half-sphere is* \sidenote{* We could
    also use the formula for the surface area of the sphere, but let's
    do it from scratch}
  \[
    \int_S 1 \, \d{A} = \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}
    \overbrace{1}^{1} \overbrace{\sin\phi}^{|\partial_\theta
      \mathbf{r}\times \partial_\phi \mathbf{r}|} \, \d \phi \, \d
    \theta = 2\pi. 
  \]
  Therefore, the average value of $z$ is
  $\displaystyle{\frac{\pi}{2\pi}} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}$.

Let's define the vector $\mathbf{A}$ whose length is equal to $A$ and
whose direction is orthogonal to the net. Then the \textbf{flow}
$Av \cos \theta$ can be written as
\[
  \text{flow} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{v}, 
\]
where $\mathbf{v}$ is the river's velocity vector. 

\begin{example}{}{waterflow}
  Suppose that the velocity field of a body of water is given by
  $\mathbf{F} = \langle -2y, 4z, x\rangle$ (in meters per second) and
  that a rectangular net is positioned in the water with corners at
  $(1,1,3)$, $(1,4,3)$, $(1,4,5)$, and $(1,1,5)$ (in meters). Find the
  volume of water flowing through the frame of the net per second. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Since the velocity field isn't constant, we divide the net into
  small patches and treat the velocity as constant on each one. Since
  the rectangle is contained in the plane $x=1$, the vector
  $\langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle$ is normal to the rectangle. Therefore, the flow
  through a small patch of area $\Delta A$ located at $(x,y,z)$ is
  approximately equal to
  \[
    \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \big\langle \Delta A, 0, 0 \big\rangle \cdot
    \big\langle -2y, 4z, x \big\rangle = -2y \, \Delta A. 
  \]
  If we sum the flow through each patch across the whole rectangular
  region occupied by the net, we get a Riemann sum that converges as
  $\Delta A \to 0$ to
  \[
    \int_1^4 \int_3^5 (-2y) \, \d z \, \d y = -30. 
  \]
  Therefore, the volume of water is \boxed{30} cubic meters per
  second, and the net flow is in the direction \textit{towards} the
  side facing the $yz$-plane.
\end{solution}

The ideas in Example~\ref{exam:waterflow} yield the following
definition, which develops the notion of vector field integration over
surfaces in terms of the scalar surface
integral.\sidenote{A surface with a distinguished side is called an

\begin{defn}{}{flow}
  The \textbf{flow} of a vector field $\mathbf{F}$ through a surface

    \, {\d}A, 
  \]
  where $\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{n}(x,y,z)$ is a unit vector which is
  orthogonal to $S$ at each point $(x,y,z)$ and points in the
  direction from $\mathfrak{s}$ to $\mathfrak{t}$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Find the flow of the vector field $\mathbf{F} = \langle x^2, y^2, z^2 \rangle$
  from the inside to the outside of the unit sphere. 
\end{exercise}

We can write down an integral formula for calculating flow through an
arbitrary parametrized surface $S$. Since both $\partial_u \mathbf{r}$
and $\partial_v \mathbf{r}$ are tangent to the surface $S$, the cross
product of $\partial_u \mathbf{r} $ and $\partial_v \mathbf{r}$ is
orthogonal to $S$. When we divide this cross product by its length and
substitute into Theorem~\ref{th:surfformula}, we get a cancellation of
the $|\partial_u \mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r}|$ factors. In
other words,
$\d\mathbf{A} = \partial_u \mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r} \,
\d u \, \d v$, so to find the flow we can dot $\mathbf{F}$ with
$\partial_u \mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r}$ and integrate
over $D$:

\begin{theo}{(Flow integral formula)}{flowformula}
  If $\mathbf{r}:D \to \R^3$ is a parameterization of a surface $S$
  such that at each point of $S$, the vector
  $\partial_u \mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r}$ points from one
  side $\mathfrak{s}$ of $S$ to the other side $\mathfrak{t}$, then
  the flow of $\mathbf{F}$ through $S$ from $\mathfrak{s}$ to
  $\mathfrak{t}$ is \milink{parametrized_surface_introduction}{surface
    parameterization}
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:surfformula} 
    \iint_S \mathbf{F}\cdot \, {\d}\mathbf{A} = \iint_D
    \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r}(u,v)) \cdot (\partial_u
    \mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r}) \, {\d}u\,{\d}v. 
  \end{equation}
\end{theo}

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the flow of the vector field $\mathbf{F} = \langle y^2, 0, z
  \rangle$ up through the part of the paraboloid $z = 4 - x^2 - y^2$
  above the $xy$-plane. 
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  Let's parametrize the surface using the cylindrical coordinates $u=r$
  and $v=\theta$, so that
  \[
    \mathbf{r}(u,v) = \langle u\cos v, u \sin v, 4 - u^2 \rangle, 
  \]
  where $(u,v)$ ranges over $[0,2] \times [0,2\pi]$. Then 
  \[
    \partial_u \mathbf{r}(u,v) = \langle \cos v, \sin v, -2u \rangle \quad \text{ and } \quad
    \partial_v \mathbf{r}(u,v) = \langle -u\sin v, u \cos v, 0
    \rangle, 
  \]
  which yields 
  \[
    \partial_u\mathbf{r} \times \partial_v \mathbf{r} = \langle 2 u^{2} \cos v,2 u^{2} \sin v, u \rangle. 
  \]
  This vector indeed points from the bottom side of the surface to the
  top, so Theorem~\ref{th:flowformula} tells us that the desired flow
  is 
  \[
    \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2} \langle u^2 \sin^2 v, 0, 4-u^2
    \rangle \cdot \langle 2 u^{2} \cos v,2 u^{2} \sin v, u \rangle \,
    \d u \, \d{v}, 
  \]
  which simplifies to
  \[
    \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2} (2 u^4 \sin^2 v \cos v + 4u - u^3)
    \d u \, \d{v} = \boxed{8\pi}.

\section{Divergence and curl} \label{sec:divcurl} 

One classic and well-known vector calculus book is \textit{div, grad,
  curl, and all that} by H.M. Schey.* We have already discussed the
gradient, and in this section we will develop the two other
fundamental vector calculus derivative operators: divergence and
curl. We will emphasize the underlying physical intuition. \sidenote{*
  Highly recommended}[-5mm]

\subsection{Divergence}

\milink[-6mm]{divergence_idea}{divergence} 

\begin{defn}{Divergence}{divergence}
  The \textbf{divergence} of a vector field
  $\mathbf{F} = \langle M, N, P \rangle$ is a scalar function defined
  by
  \[
    \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \partial_x M  +\partial _y N + \partial_z
    P. 
  \]
\end{defn}

For example, the divergence of $\langle x^2, xy, z \rangle$ is
$2x + x + 1 = 3x + 1$. The divergence of $\mathbf{F}$ can be
interpreted physically as the \textbf{net flow} of $\mathbf{F}$ out of
a small region located at $(x,y,z)$ per volume of that region. 

\sidenote{* We dot the normal vector $\langle 0, 0, 1
  \rangle$ with $\langle M, N, P \rangle$ to account for the cosine
  factor}
To see this, note that if we put a small box of dimensions $\Delta x, \Delta y, \Delta z$
around $(x,y,z)$, then the net flow through the top of the box is
approximately* $P(x,y,z+\Delta z)\Delta x \Delta y$, and the net flow
through the bottom of the box is approximately
$P(x, y, z)\, \Delta x \,\Delta y$. Thus the difference is approximately
$(\partial_z P)(x,y,z) \, \Delta x \,  \Delta y \, \Delta z$, and the
difference per unit volume is $\partial_z P(x,y,z)$. Similarly, the front/back
and left/right sides contribute $\partial_x M(x,y,z)$ and $\partial_y N(x,y,z)$ to
the net flow density through the small box.

\begin{solution}
  We can see that in the top left of the diagram that there is more
  flow into each small region than out of it, since the vectors are
  downward-pointing and longer than the vectors below them. Therefore,
  the divergence is negative in the top left.

  By similar reasoning, we see that the divergence is positive in the
  bottom-right part of the figure. The dividing line between regions
  of positive and negative divergence is $y = x$, since points along
  that line have vectors of equal length pointing towards and away
  from them.

\subsection{Curl}

\milink[-6mm]{curl_idea}{curl} 

\begin{defn}{Curl}{curl}
  The \textbf{curl} of a vector field $\mathbf{F} = \langle M, N, P \rangle$ is
  a vector field on $\R^3$ defined by \renewcommand\arraystretch{1.4}
  \[
    \nabla \times \mathbf{F} =
    \left|
      \begin{array}{ccc}
        \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
        \partial_x  & \partial_y & \partial_z \\
        M         &       N       &      P
      \end{array} 
    \right| = \big\langle \partial_y P - \partial_z N, \:
    -\partial_x P  + \partial_z M, \:
    \partial_x N - \partial_y M \big\rangle. 
  \]
\end{defn}

We've already seen the third component, $\partial_x N - \partial_y M$,
in Green's theorem. In the context, $\partial_x N - \partial_y M$
measures the line integral (per unit of enclosed area) around a small
loop perpendicular to the $z$-axis. This quantity is called
\textbf{circulation density}. The other two components of
$\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$ supplement this information by providing
the circulation density with respect to the $x$ and $y$ directions.

We can visualize this idea physically by interpreting the vector field
as a flow velocity and imagining placing a small paddle wheel (with an
axis of rotation in the $x$, $y$, or $z$ direction) at a particular
point in this field. The corresponding component of the curl measures
how rapidly and in which direction this paddle wheel turns.

    \end{lrbox} \raisebox{\dimexpr -\height + 1.5ex}{\usebox{\asybox}}
  \end{minipage}
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We can see that if we place a small paddle wheel at a point of
  interest (as shown in the figure above) it will rotate in the
  counterclockwise direction. This is because the vectors on the right
  (meaning the side where $x$ is larger) push harder than the vectors
  on the left. Therefore, the $z$-component of the curl is
  $\boxed{\text{positive}}$.
\end{solution}

When we studied gradients, we learned that directional derivatives of
a function in the coordinate directions determine its directional
derivatives in all directions: the derivative in the
$\langle u_1, u_2 \rangle$ direction is equal to a linear combination
with weights $u_1$ and $u_2$ of the derivatives in the coordinate
directions. The same idea holds for the curl:
\begin{theo}{}{curl} \bang{-3mm} The circulation density of a vector
  field $\mathbf{F}$ with respect to a unit vector $\mathbf{u} $ is
  equal to $\left(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\right) \cdot
  \mathbf{u}$.
\end{theo}


This means that if $C_r$ is a small loop of radius $r$ which is
perpendicular to $\mathbf{u}$ and oriented counterclockwise as viewed
from the head of $\mathbf{u}$, then the ratio of
$\int_{C_r} \mathbf{F} \cdot \d\mathbf{r}$ to the area enclosed by
$C_r$ is approximately equal to the value of
$\left(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\right) \cdot \mathbf{u}$ at some point
inside the loop. More precisely, if we shrink $C_r$ down around a
point by taking $r \to 0$, then the limit of
$\int_{C_r} \mathbf{F} \cdot \d\mathbf{r}$ divided by the area
enclosed by $C_r$ converges to
$\left(\nabla \times \mathbf{F}\right) \cdot \mathbf{u}$ at that
point.
\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the orientation for a paddle wheel at the point $(1,1,1)$ in
  the velocity field $\langle xyz,x^2 - y, z \rangle$ which will
  maximize how fast it spins.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}
  We calculate the curl:
  $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \langle 0, xy, -xz + 2x \rangle$, which
  at the point $(1,1,1)$ is equal to $\langle 0,1,1 \rangle$. Since
  the dot product of a fixed vector $\mathbf{v}$ with a unit vector is
  maximized when the unit vector is aligned with $\mathbf{v}$, we see
  that the paddle wheel should be oriented so that its axis is in the
  direction
  $\boxed{\left\langle 0, \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right\rangle}$.

Suppose that $\mathbf{F}: \R^3 \to \R^3$ is a vector field. As
discussed in the previous section, the divergence of $\mathbf{F}$ at
each point measures the net flow of $\mathbf{F}$ out of a small region
around that point, per unit volume. Note that to integrate
$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ over a region $D$ in $\R^3$, we divide $D$
into many small pieces, multiply the volume of each piece by the value
of $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$ there, and sum the results. The
contribution of each piece is the net flow out of that piece*, so when
we add the contributions of all the pieces, we get the net flow out of
$D$. This idea is called the \textit{divergence theorem}.  \sidenote{*
  The contribution of each piece is the divergence somewhere in the
  piece times its volume, and the divergence equals flow per unit
  volume, so the product is the net flow out of the piece}[-1cm]

The planar domain $D$ in Green's theorem can be thought of as a
surface $S$, in which case the conclusion of Green's theorem can be
written as
\[
  \iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot
  \d\mathbf{A} =
  \int_{\partial S} \mathbf{F} \cdot
  \d\mathbf{r}. 
\]
The argument for Green's theorem then applies even if $S$ doesn't lie
in a plane, because Theorem~\ref{th:curl} tells us that
$\nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \d\mathbf{A}$ measures the circulation
around a small patch of the surface $S$. As we discussed for Green's
theorem, if you divide a surface into many small patches and sum the
circulations around all of them, you get the circulation around the

known as \textit{Stokes' theorem}.* \sidenote{* If you take a

  If $\mathbf{F} : \R^3 \to \R^3$ is a vector field with continuous
  partial derivatives and $S$ is a surface in $\R^3$, then*
  \sidenote{* The orientation used for the surface integral must be

  \[
    \overbrace{\iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot
      \d\mathbf{A}}^{\text{pointwise circulation density integrated
        over $S$}} =
    \overbrace{\int_{\partial S} \mathbf{F} \cdot
      \d\mathbf{r}}^{\text{circulation around $\partial S$}}. 
  \]
\end{theo}

\begin{example}{}{stokes}
  Let $\mathbf{F} = \langle x \sin (\pi y), \e^x, -\cos(\pi z)
  \rangle$. Find the flow of $\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$ up through the
  surface shown in Exercise~\ref{exer:weirdsurface}.
\end{example}

\begin{solution} 
  Stokes' theorem tells us that the flow of $\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$
  upwards through $S$ is equal to the line integral of $\mathbf{F}$
  around $\partial S$ in the counterclockwise direction (see
  Figure~\ref{fig:Stokes}). Since $\partial S$ consists of four line
  segments, we calculate $\int \mathbf{F} \cdot {\d}\mathbf{r}$ along
  each edge and sum the results. Integrating from $(0,0,0)$ to
  $(1,0,0)$, we get
  \[
    \int_0^1\mathbf{F}(x,0,0) \cdot \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle  \, \d x =
    0. 
  \]
  From $(1,0,0)$ to $(1,1,0)$, we get
  \[
    \int_0^1\mathbf{F}(1,y,0) \cdot \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle  \, \d y =
    e. 
  \]
  From $(1,1,0)$ to $(0,1,0)$, we get
  \[
    \int_0^1\mathbf{F}(x,1,0) \cdot \langle -1, 0, 0 \rangle  \, \d x = 0. 
  \]
  And finally from $(0,1,0)$ back to the origin, we get
  \[
    \int_0^1\mathbf{F}(0,y,0) \cdot \langle 0, -1, 0 \rangle  \, \d y = -1. 
  \]
  So altogether the circulation of $\mathbf{F}$ around the boundary of
  $S$ is $\boxed{e-1}$. 
\end{solution}

Theorem~\ref{th:stokes} implies that for any vector field
$\mathbf{F}$, a surface can be deformed without changing the flow of
$\nabla \times \mathbf{F}$ through it, as long as it is deformed in
such a way that its boundary is preserved:

\begin{obs}{}{stokes}
  In the context of Stokes' theorem, if $S_1$ and $S_2$ are surfaces
  whose boundaries are the same, then
  \[
    \iint_{S_1} (\nabla \times \mathbf{F}) \cdot \d\mathbf{A} =
    \iint_{S_2}
    (\nabla \times \mathbf{F})
    \cdot \d\mathbf{A}.

  We parametrize the cone as

  ranges over $[1,4]\times [0,2\pi]$.  We also calculate
  $\nabla \times \mathbf{F} = \langle 0, 0, -x^2 \rangle$. Then applying
  the parametrization formula for flow (Theorem~\ref{th:flowformula}),
  we get 
  \[
    \iint_S \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \cdot \d\mathbf{A} =
    \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{1}^{4} \langle 0, 0, -u^2\cos^2 v \rangle \cdot
    \langle -u  \cos v, -u \sin v, u \rangle \, \d u\, \d v = -

  \]
  \insetfigure{Since the normal vector
    $\langle -u \cos v, -u \sin v, u \rangle$ points in/up for all

    represents the flow of the curl $\mathbf{F}$ from the
    \textit{outside} of the cone to the \textit{inside}. We should be
    careful to orient the boundary arcs in a manner which is
    compatible with this orientation. We can do this by following the
    derivation of Stokes' theorem: we subdivide the surface into many
    small patches, and we orient each little boundary in the
    counterclockwise direction around the normal vector used in the
    surface integral (in this case, in/up). Then the boundary of $S$
    is obtained by putting together the oriented segments whose
    contributions aren't canceled (see the small oriented red loop in
    Figure~\ref{fig:stokesorientation}). We can see from this
    procedure that the top edge of the surface is oriented
    counterclockwise when viewed from
    above. }{\usebox{\asybox}}[\captionof{figure}{The normal vectors
    for the surface integral and the corresponding orientations of the
    boundary arcs in Stokes' theorem \label{fig:stokesorientation}}]

  Since the bottom edge of each patch is oriented \textit{clockwise}
  when viewed from above, the bottom edge of the surface should be
  oriented clockwise. So we can parametrize the top edge as
  $\langle 4 \cos t, 4 \sin t, 4 \rangle$ and the bottom edge as*
  \sidenote{We reverse the orientation by replacing $t$ with $-t$, and
    then we can use the identities $\cos(-t) = \cos t$ and
    $\sin(-t) = -\sin t$} $\langle\cos t, - \sin t, 1\rangle$, in both
  cases as $t$ ranges from $0$ to $2\pi$. We get
  \[
    \int_{\partial S} \mathbf{F} \cdot \d{\mathbf{r}} =
    \int_{0}^{2\pi} \mathbf{F}(4\cos t, 4\sin t, 4) \cdot \langle
    -4\sin t, 4 \cos t, 0 \rangle \, \d{t} +
    \int_{0}^{2\pi} \mathbf{F}(\cos t, -\sin t, 1) \cdot \langle
    -\sin t, -\cos t, 0 \rangle \, \d{t}
  \]
  which works out to
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{0}^{2\pi} \left[(4\cos t)^2 (4\sin t)(-4\sin t) + (4)(4\cos t) +
    0 \, \right] &\d t  + \int_{0}^{2\pi}\left[ \cos^2 t (-\sin t)^2 + (1)(-\cos t) +
                   0\, \right]\d t \\ &= -64\pi + \frac{\pi}{4} = -
                                        \frac{255\pi}{4}, 
  \end{align*}
  as desired. 
\end{solution}

The following consequence of Stokes' theorem tells us that the flow
of the curl of a vector field through a closed surface (such as a
sphere, a donut, or a rectangular prism) is zero:

\begin{obs}{}{stokes2}
  If $\mathbf{G}$ is a vector field which is equal to the curl of
  some vector field with continuous partial derivatives and if $S$
  is a piecewise smooth closed surface (in other words, a surface
  with no boundary), then the flow of $\mathbf{G}$ through $S$ is
  zero.
\end{obs}

  \rangle$.

\section{Review} 

\subsection{Sets and functions}  \label{a:setsandfunctions}

A \textbf{set} is a collection of elements. These elements can be
numbers, points, shapes, vectors, other sets, whatever. For example,
\[
  A = \{1,4,9\} 
\]
is the set consisting of the positive, single-digit perfect
squares. The main thing you can do with a set is check whether a
particular element is in it. For example, we say that $1 \in A$ (read
``1 is an element of $A$''), while $2 \notin A$ (``2 is not an element
of $A$'').

Some sets with standard and specially typeset names include 
\begin{itemize} 
\item $\R$, the set of real numbers, 
\item $\mathbb{Q}$, the set of rational numbers, 
\item $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers, and 
\item $\mathbb{N}$, the set of natural numbers. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Subsets and set equality, parbox = false,
  colframe = MidnightBlue, colback=softblue]
  We say that $A \subset B$ (read ``$A$ is a \textbf{subset} of $B$'')
  if every element of $A$ is an element of $B$. For example,
  \[
    \{1,4,9\} \subset \{1,2,3,4,9,10\}. 
  \]
  We say that two sets $A$ and $B$ are \textbf{equal} if $A\subset B$ and $B\subset A$. Note that 
  \[
    \{1,1,2\} = \{1,2\} = \{2,1\} . 
  \]
  since each element of each set is in the others. Thus we can see that
  sets ``don't care'' about repeated elements or order. All that
matters is what is in and what is not. It is customary to writesets with
  repeats omitted, for clarity.
\end{tcolorbox} \enlargethispage{1cm} 

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Intersections and unions, parbox = false,
  colframe = MidnightBlue, colback=softblue] 
  We write $A\cap B$, the \textbf{intersection} of $A$ and $B$, for
  the set of all the elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. So, for
  example,
  \[
    \{1,4,9\} \cap \{ x \in \R \,: x^2 > 15 \} = \{4,9\}. 
  \]
  That second set on the left-hand side, which is written in
  \textit{set-builder} notation, is read as ``the set of all real
  numbers $x$ such that the square of $x$ is greater than 15''.

  We write $A\cup B$, the \textbf{union} of $A$ and $B$, for the set
  of all the elements that are in either $A$ or $B$. So, for example,
  \[
    \{1,4,9\} \cup \{1,9,25\} = \{1,4,9,25\}. 
  \]
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Functions, breakable, parbox = false,
  colframe = MidnightBlue, colback=softblue]
  If $A$ and $B$ are sets, then a function $f:A \to B$ is a rule that
  assigns a single element of $B$ to each element of $A$. The set $A$
  is called the \textbf{domain} of $f$ and $B$ is called the
  \textbf{codomain} of $f$. Given a subset $A'$ of $A$, we define the
  \textbf{image} $f(A')$ to be
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:image} 
    f(A') = \{b \in B \, : \, \text{there exists }a \in A' \text{ so that } f(a) = b\}. 
  \end{equation} 
  This is the set of all elements of $B$ that get mapped to from some
  element of $A'$. The \textbf{range} of $f$ is defined to be the set
  $f(A)$, which contains all the elements of $B$ that get mapped to at
  least once.

  Similarly, if $B'\subset B$, then the \textbf{preimage} $f^{-1}(B')$ of $B'$ is defined by 
  \[
    f^{-1}(B') = \{a \in A \, : f(a) \in B'\}. 
  \]
  This is the subset of $A$ consisting of every element of $A$ that
  maps to some element of $B'$.

  A function $f$ is \textbf{injective} if no two elements in the
  domain map to the same element in the codomain; in other words if
  $f(a) = f(a')$ implies $a=a'$.

  A function $f$ is \textbf{surjective} if the range of $f$ is equal
  to the codomain of $f$; in other words, if $b \in B$ implies that
  there exists $a\in A$ with $f(a) = b$.

  A function $f$ is \textbf{bijective} if it is both injective and
  surjective. This means that for every $b\in B$, there is exactly one
  $a\in A$ such that $f(a) \in b$. If $f$ is bijective, then the
  function from $B$ to $A$ that maps $b\in B$ to the element $a \in A$
  that satisfies $f(a) = b$ is called the \textbf{inverse} of $f$.

  If $f: A \to B$ and $A' \subset A$, then the \textbf{restriction} of
  $f$ to $A$ is the function $\left. f \right|_{A'} : A' \to B$ defined
  by $\left. f \right|_{A'}(x) = f(x)$ for all $x \in A'$.

  If $f: A \to B$ and $g:B \to C$, then the function $g\circ f$ which
  maps $x \in A$ to $g(f(x))\in C$ is called the \textbf{composition} of
  $g$ and $f$. 

  If the rule defining a function is sufficiently simple, we can
  describe the function using \textbf{anonymous function notation}. For
  example, $x \in \R\mapsto x^2 \in \R$, or $x\mapsto x^2$ for short, is
  the squaring function from $\R$ to $\R$. Note that bar on the left
  edge of the arrow, which distinguishes the arrow in anonymous function
  notation from the arrow between the domain and codomain of a named
  function.
\end{tcolorbox}

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Cartesian product, breakable, parbox =
  false, colframe = MidnightBlue, colback=softblue]
  The \textbf{Cartesian product} of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted
  $A \times B$, is the set of all pairs $(a,b)$ where $a\in A$ and
  $b\in B$. For example, $[0,3] \times [0,2]$ is a rectangle in the
  plane. We sometimes use exponents for a Cartesian product of a set
  with itself. Thus $[0,1]^2$ is a unit square in $\R^2$, and
  $[0,1]^3$ is a unit cube in $\R^3$.
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsection{Trig review} \label{sec:trigreview} 

This appendix provides a streamlined presentation of
trig which is intended to provide enough starting off points to
recover everything else you need. 

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Trig Review, colback = softblue, breakable, 
  colframe = MidnightBlue] 
  \begin{enumerate}[itemsep = 8pt, parsep = 6pt, leftmargin = 3pt]

  \item \textbf{Cosine and sine}. The basic trig functions are
    $\cos \theta$ and $\sin \theta$.  The most important definition of
    these functions is the following: the cosine of an angle $\theta$
    is equal to the $\mathbf{x}$-\textbf{coordinate} of the point
    obtained by rotating $(1,0)$ an angle of $\theta$ about the
    origin. Sine is the same, but with the $y$-coordinate instead of
    $x$.

    \bang{2mm} This idea bears repeating: {\color{DarkRed} the point
      on the unit circle obtained by rotating $(1,0)$ an angle
      $\theta$ about the origin is equal to
      $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$, \textbf{by definition of cosine
        and sine}.}
    
  \item \textbf{The other ones}. The other four trig functions are
    simply abbreviations for various combinations of sine and cosine:
    \begin{center}  
      \begin{tabular}{cc} 
        $\sin\theta=\sin\theta$ & $\sec\theta=\tfrac{1}{\cos\theta}$ \\
        $\rule{0pt}{20pt}\cos\theta=\cos\theta$ & $\csc\theta=\tfrac{1}{\sin\theta}$ \\
        $\rule{0pt}{20pt}\tan\theta=\tfrac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$ &
                                                                      $\cot\theta=\tfrac{\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}$
        \\
      \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

  \item \textbf{Special right triangles}. The following two triangles,
    each half of a regular polygon, can be handy for evaluating trig
    functions at special angles.
    \begin{center}
      \begin{asy}[width=0.5\textwidth]

        label("$\displaystyle{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}$",(shift+1,sqrt(3)*0.44),E);
        label("1",(shift+0.5,sqrt(3)/2),NW);
        label("$60^\circ$",(shift+arceps,0.5*arceps));
        label("$30^\circ$",(shift+1-arceps/2,sqrt(3)-2*arceps));
      \end{asy}
    \end{center}
    
  \item \textbf{Pythagorean identities}. The famous identity
    $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$ follows from the definition of
    sine and cosine combined with the Pythagorean theorem. Dividing
    both sides of this equation by $\sin^2\theta$ or $\cos^2\theta$,
    we get
    \[
      \tan^2 \theta + 1 = \sec^2 \theta \qquad  \text{ and } \qquad 
      1 + \cot^2 \theta = \csc^2 \theta. 
    \]
    
  \item \textbf{Sum-angle formulas}. The sine sum-angle formula is
    worth memorizing: for all $\alpha$ and $\beta$, we have
    \[
      \boxed{\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \sin \beta \cos
        \alpha} \,.
    \] 
    The cosine sum-angle formula is worth memorizing too, although it
    can be derived fairly easily from the sine formula by substituting
    $\tfrac{\pi}{2} - \alpha$ for $\alpha$ and $-\beta$ for $\beta$.
    We get
    \[
      \cos(\alpha + \beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin \alpha \sin
      \beta .
    \]
    
  \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}
From the above identities, we can derive many others. For example,
setting $\alpha = \beta$ in the cosine sum-angle formula, we get
\[
  \cos 2 \alpha = \cos^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \alpha. 
\]
Substituting $\cos^2\alpha = 1 - \sin^2\alpha$, we find that 
\[
  \cos 2\alpha = 1 - 2\sin^2\alpha. 
\]
which can be solved to express $\sin^2\alpha$ in terms of $\cos
2\alpha$.

\subsection{Summation notation}

Some shorthand is essential for writing sums with many terms. Perhaps
the most common approach is to use ellipses:
\[
  1 + 2  + 3 + \cdots + 99 + 100 = 5050. 
\]
However, this approach is not ideal because the reader is left to
infer the pattern.

When more precision is required, we would like to specify a formula
for the $k$th term as well as a starting and ending value. For
example, the sum
\[
  1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + \cdots + 100
\]
can be written as ``the sum of $k^2$ as $k$ ranges from 1 to
10''. The math notation that has been adopted for abbreviating this
English phrase is the following:
\[
  \sum_{k=1}^{10} k^2 
\]
The variable $k$ is called a \textit{dummy variable}, since it is
only there as a way to specify a formula for generating the
terms. We could change each $k$ to a different symbol without
changing the essential meaning, which is ``sum the first 10 positive
perfect squares''.

\subsection{Visualizing functions}

Graphical visualization is an important conceptual tool for reasoning
about the behavior of functions. There are a variety of different
methods for visualizing functions (see the table on the next page
for pictures):

\begin{tcolorbox}[title = Function Visualization Methods, colback =
  softblue, colframe = MidnightBlue] 
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin = 12pt, itemsep = 6pt, parsep = 6pt]
  \item \textbf{Graphs}. The graph of a function $f : \R^1 \to \R^1$ is
    the set of points of the form $(x,f(x))$, where $x$ is in the
    domain of $f$. The graph of a function $f : \R^2 \to \R^1$ is
    the set of points of the form $(x,y,f(x,y))$, where $(x,y)$ is in the
    domain of $f$. The graph uses one or two dimensions for the input
    and one dimension for the output, so it only works (as a
    visualization tool) for $f : \R^n \to \R^m$ if $m + n \leq 3$.

    The graph involves no loss of information; in principle, you can
    read off anything you want to know about a function from its
    graph. It depicts the domain and the codomain in the same picture. 
    
  \item \textbf{Level sets}. A level set of a function $f:\R^2 \to \R$
    is the solution set of an equation of the form $f(x,y) = c$, where
    $c$ is some constant. For example, the $c=1$ level set of the
    function $x^2 + y^2$ is the unit circle. The level set of a
    function $f:\R^3 \to \R$ is typically a \textit{surface}, For
    example, the level sets of $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ are spheres.

    We can visualize a function by drawing its level sets. However,
    there are a couple drawbacks: we have to choose a discrete number
    of level sets to draw, and the picture doesn't tell us which $c$
    value corresponds to each level set, unless we draw that
    information in with colors or labels. When we visualize a function
    in this way, we are looking only at the \textit{domain} of the
    function. 

  \item \textbf{Grid lines}. For a function $T$ from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$, we can
    understand $T$ as a transformation which moves points in the plane
    to other points in the plane, and we can visualize this geometric
    action by drawing the images of various grid lines under $T$. This
    visualization is drawn on the codomain side and loses some
    information about which grid lines match to which images. 
    
  \item \textbf{Traces}. We can visualize a function $\mathbf{r}$ from
    $\R^1$ to $\R^2$ or $\R^3$ by highlighting every point in $\R^2$
    or $\R^3$ which is equal to $\mathbf{r}(t)$ for some $t\in
    \R$. This set of points is called the \textit{trace} of
    $\mathbf{r}$.

    The trace is drawn entirely on the codomain side, which means that
    this visualization lacks information about which $t$ value or
    values mapped to each highlighted point.

  \item \textbf{Vector fields}. For functions from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ or
    $\R^3$ to $\R^3$, we can visualize them by interpreting the output
    value as a vector and depicting a discrete set of these vectors as small
    arrows drawn in place at the corresponding input values. Doing this
    requires scaling the vectors down so the picture doesn't get
    chaotic. This visualization incorporates inputs and outputs in the
    same picture, and information is lost about the absolute size
    of each vector and about what happens between the discrete set of
    input values shown. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{tcolorbox}

Table~\ref{table:visualizations} below shows examples of each type of
visualization, with the input (domain) dimension varying by row and
the output (codomain) dimension by column. An example of a common type
of visualization is shown for each input-output pair of dimensions.

In a couple cases, the method shown isn't the only one in common use:
a function from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$ can also be drawn as a vector field
(particularly if one is thinking of the outputs as vectors rather than
points in $\R^2$), and the level set method shown for a function from
$\R^3$ to $\R^1$ can also be applied to a function from $\R^2$ to
$\R^1$.

Conventional names are used for each function; note that these vary by
input and output dimension. Functions from $\R^3$ to $\R^2$ don't have
a dedicated visualization method, although one could visualize each
component of such a function separately, or identify the codomain
$\R^2$ with the $xy$-plane in $\R^3$ to make a vector field
representation.

\end{wrapfigure}
Recall that $f(x)$ converges to $L$ as $x\to a$ if $f(x)$ can be made
as close to $L$ as desired by restricting $x$ to a sufficiently small
neighborhood of $a$. More precisely, $f(x)$ converges to $L$ as
$x\to a$ if and only if for every $\epsilon > 0$, there is $\delta>0$
so that $f(x)$ within $\epsilon$ of $L$ for all $x$ satisfying
$0 < |x - a| < \delta$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:oneDlimit}). \sidenote{*
  We abbreviate ``$f(x)$ converges to $L$ as $x\to a$'' to
  $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = L}$}

It can be helpful to think of this definition as a game against an
adversary: the adversary chooses a positive real number $\epsilon$
which can be as small as they like. Then, after seeing the $\epsilon$
value, you get to choose a number $\delta>0$, as small as you
like. Finally, the adversary chooses an $x$ value in the interval
$(a-\delta, a + \delta)$ which is not equal to $a$. If it turns out
that $|f(x) - L| \geq \epsilon$, then the adversary wins. Otherwise,
you win. We call this the \textbf{limit game}.

If you have a strategy for winning this game no matter how the
adversary plays, then the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ exists
and equals $L$. If the adversary has a strategy for winning, then it
is not true that $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$ (either because the limit
does not exist or because the limit exists and equals a number other
than $L$).

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Show that $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 3}}\dfrac{x^2 - 9}{x - 3} = 6$
  by explaining the winning strategy in the limit game.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Suppose that $f$ is a function from $\R$ to $\R$ and that
  $a \in \R$. Show that if $f(x)$ converges to $L$ as $x\to a$ and
  $f(x)$ converges to $L'$ as $x\to a$, then $L = L'$. This fact is
  called \textit{uniqueness of limits}.
\end{exercise}

We reviewed the definition of a limit for a single-variable function
so we could think about how to generalize the definition for a
function $f:\R^n \to \R$. For simplicity, let's take $n = 2$. What
should it mean to say
$\displaystyle{\lim_{(x,y) \to (a,b)} f(x,y)} = L$? The only aspect of
the definition that requires revision is the part about $x$ being
within $\delta$ of $a$, and we can use standard Euclidean distance to
compare $(x,y)$ to $(a,b)$. This leads to the following
definition.

\begin{defn}{Limit of a function of two variables}{limit}
  We say $\lim_{(x,y)\to (a,b)} f(x,y) = L$ if and only if for every
  $\epsilon > 0$, there is $\delta>0$ so that
  $|f(x,y) - L| < \epsilon$ for all $(x,y)$ satisfying
  $0 < \sqrt{(x -a)^2 + (y-b)^2} < \delta$.

shadow$^\dagger$ of the disk* $B((a,b),\delta)$ on the graph (see
Figure~\ref{fig:twoDlimit}). The limit exists and equals $L$ if for
every $\epsilon$, there exists $\delta$ small enough that this shadow

\subsection{A rigorous formulation of arclength}
\label{sec:arclengthappendix}

In Section~\ref{subsec:arclength}, we defined arclength only for
piecewise differentiable paths. In this appendix, we provide a more
natural and general definition which also resolves the question of
parameterization independence. Recall that a \textbf{path} in $\R^n$
is a continuous function from some interval $[a,b]$ to $\R^n$. We
distinguish a path from its \textbf{trajectory}, which is the set of
points that the path passes through.* \sidenote{* To appreciate the
  difference, note that the path contains information about how
  quickly the trajectory is traced out, while knowing the trajectory
  only tells us which points were passed through}

Consider an arbitrary path $\mathbf{r}:[a,b] \to \R^3$. Consider any
finite sequence $S$ of points $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ in order along
the path, and connect them with line segments. The length of this path
of line segments is
\[
  |\overrightarrow{P_0P_1}| +
  |\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}| + \cdots +
  |\overrightarrow{P_{n-1}P_n}|, 
\]
and we will call this quantity $\ell(S)$.

\begin{exercise}{}{intuition} \parskip = 6pt 
  Although we haven't defined the length of $\mathbf{r}$ yet, explain
  intuitively why $\ell(S)$ \textit{should} be less than the length of
  $\mathbf{r}$.

  Also, explain qualitatively how one might choose the points in $S$
  so as to make $\ell(S)$ very close to the length of $\mathbf{r}$
  (again assuming an intuitive notion of the length of $\mathbf{r}$).
\end{exercise}

Motivated by Exercise~\ref{exer:intuition}, we make the following
definition.  

\begin{defn}{Arclength, for a general path}{arclengthforreal}
  \parskip = 0.1 in 
  The \textbf{length} of a path is defined to be the smallest real
  number which is greater than or equal to $\ell(S)$ for every
  finite sequence $S$ of points along the path.

  If no such number exists, then we define the length of the path to be
  $+\infty$. 
\end{defn}

Since $S$ is just a sequence of points along the path, the set of
sequences under consideration in
Definition~\ref{defn:arclengthforreal} is the same regardless of
the parameterization.

\begin{theo}{Parameterization Independence}{}
  If $\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\mathbf{r}_2$ are two paths which visit the
  same points in the same order*, then their lengths are the
  same. \sidenote{* Rigorously, this means that there exists an
    increasing, continuous function $\sigma$ from the domain of
    $\vec{r}_1$ to the domain of $\mathbf{r}_2$ such that
    $\vec{r}_1 = \vec{r}_2 \circ \sigma$}[-2cm]
\end{theo}

The following theorem shows that the formula given in
Section~\ref{subsec:arclength} indeed agrees with
Definition~\ref{defn:arclengthforreal}.* For simplicity, we assume
that $\mathbf{r}'(t)$ exists for all $t$ and that $\mathbf{r}'$ is
continuous on $[a,b]$---in other words, that $\mathbf{r}$ is
\textit{continuously differentiable}.  \sidenote{* Although we took
  it as a definition in Section~\ref{subsec:arclength}, the formula in
  Definition~\ref{defn:arclength} must be treated as a
  \textit{theorem} in the present context, since we should not have
  two different definitions for the same term}[-5mm]

\begin{theo}{}{}
  Suppose $\mathbf{r}:[a,b] \to \R^3$ is continuously
  differentiable. Then the length of $\mathbf{r}$ is equal to
  $\displaystyle{\int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t}$.
\end{theo}

\begin{pf}[title=Proof (idea)]
  Recall from single-variable calculus that
  $\displaystyle{\int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t}$ is defined to be a limit of
  Riemann sums of the form
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:riemannsum}
    |\mathbf{r}'(s_1)|(t_1-t_0) + |\mathbf{r}'(s_2)|(t_2-t_1) + \cdots + |\mathbf{r}'(s_n)|(t_n-t_{n-1})
  \end{equation}
  where (i) $a = t_0 < t_1 < \ldots < t_n = b$ is a partition and
  (ii) $s_k$ is any number in the interval $[t_{k-1},t_k]$, for each
  $k$ from 1 to $n$. The limit is taken as the \textit{mesh}
  $\{t_0, \ldots, t_n\}$ (that is, the largest gap between
  consecutive numbers in the partition) tends to zero. 

  The main idea of the proof is to show that the segment path
  lengths $\ell(S)$ in Definition~\ref{defn:arclengthforreal} and
  the Riemann sums \eqref{eq:riemannsum} are very close. Roughly
  speaking, the reason is that $|\mathbf{r}'(s_1)|(t_1-t_0)$ is very
  close to $|\mathbf{r}(t_1) - \mathbf{r}(t_0)|$ (and similarly for
  the other terms) by the \textbf{mean value theorem}.

  For each $k$ from 1 to $n$, we let $t_k$ be the time when the path
  visits $P_k$. Define $x$ and $y$ to be the components of
  $\mathbf{r}$; then the mean-value theorem implies that there is
  some value $s_k$ between $t_{k-1}$ and $t_k$ such that 
  \[
    x(t_k) - x(t_{k-1}) = x'(s_k)(t_{k}-t_{k-1}). 
  \]
  Similarly, there are values $\tilde{s}_k$ and $\hat{s}_k$ between
  $t_{k-1}$ and $t_k$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    y(t_k) - y(t_{k-1}) &= y'(\tilde{s}_k)(t_{k}-t_{k-1}), \text{ and}\\
    z(t_k) - z(t_{k-1}) &= z'(\hat{s}_k)(t_{k}-t_{k-1}). 
  \end{align*}
  Squaring these three equations, summing them, and taking the
  square root of both sides, we get
  \[
    |\mathbf{r}(t_k) - \mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})| = \sqrt{x'(s_k)^2 +
      y'(\tilde{s}_k)^2 + z'(\hat{s}_k)^2}\bigg(t_k-t_{k-1}\bigg). 
  \]
  The expression
  $\sqrt{x'(s_k)^2 + y'(\tilde{s}_k)^2 + z'(\hat{s}_k)^2}$ on the
  right-hand side can be made as close as desired to
  $\sqrt{x'(s_k)^2 + y'({s}_k)^2 + z'({s}_k)^2}$ for all partitions
  with suitably small mesh. Thus for any $\epsilon > 0$, we have
  \begin{align} \label{eq:ineq}
    \left(\sqrt{x'(s_k)^2 +
    y'({s}_k)^2 + z'({s}_k)^2} - \epsilon\right)
    \bigg(t_k-t_{k-1}\bigg)  
    &\leq
      |\mathbf{r}(t_k) - \mathbf{r}(t_{k-1})| \\ \nonumber
    &\leq \left(\sqrt{x'(s_k)^2 +
      y'({s}_k)^2 + z'({s}_k)^2} + \epsilon\right) \bigg(t_k-t_{k-1}\bigg)
  \end{align}
  for sufficiently fine-mesh partitions. 
  
  By definition of the Riemann integral, the quantity
  $\int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t + \epsilon$ exceeds the Riemann
  sum \eqref{eq:riemannsum} for all partitions with sufficiently
  small mesh. Summing \eqref{eq:ineq} over $k$, we see that
  $\int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t + \epsilon$ is greater than or
  equal to $\ell(S)$ for all sufficiently granular $S$, and thus* for
  all $S$. By Definition~\ref{defn:arclengthforreal}, this means that the
  length of $\mathbf{r}$ is no greater than
  $\int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t + \epsilon$. Since $\epsilon$
  is arbitrary, this means that \sidenote{* Why are lengths for
    coarse-mesh partitions less than those for fine-mesh partitions?}
  \[
    \text{length of } \mathbf{r} \leq \int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d
    t. 
  \]
  Similarly, \eqref{eq:ineq} tells us that for all $\epsilon > 0$,
  there is a sequence $S$ of points on the path such that $\ell(S)$
  exceeds $\int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d t - \epsilon$. Thus
  \[
    \text{length of } \mathbf{r} \geq \int_a^b |\mathbf{r}'(t)| \, \d
    t. 
  \]
  These two inequalities imply the theorem. 
\end{pf}

Definition~\ref{defn:arclengthforreal}, unlike
Definition~\ref{defn:arclength}, applies to \textit{fractal} curves:

\begin{exercise}{The Koch snowflake}{snowflake}
  The Koch snowflake is a fractal, meaning that it continues to look
  wiggly no matter how far you zoom in on it:

  \begin{center} 
    \includegraphics[width=4cm]{figures/koch7.pdf}
  \end{center}
  
  It is created by starting with an equilateral triangle with
  side length 1 and by repeating the following process: (1) Divide
  each line segment in the figure into three equal-length
  pieces. (2) For each line segment from Step 1, draw an equilateral
  triangle whose base is the middle segment from Step 1. (3) For
  each triangle you draw in Step 2, erase its base.

  The result of the $n$th iteration of this procedure is shown below
  for $n=0,1,2,3$. The Koch snowflake is defined to be the set of
  all points which are eventually drawn and then never erased as
  this procedure is repeated for all $n=0,1,2,\ldots$.

\subsection{Proof of the second derivative test} \label{sec:proof_sdt}

In this section we prove Theorem~\ref{th:second_test}, which we
restate here for the reader's convenience.

\begin{theo}{}{}
  \secondderivativetest
\end{theo}

\begin{pf}
  We begin by investigating the simpler case where $f$ is a quadratic
  polynomial. We can then leverage Taylor's theorem to apply that
  knowledge to the much more general class of twice-differentiable
  functions. It suffices to assume $(a,b) = (0,0)$ and that
  $f(0,0) = 0$, since $f(x,y)$ has the same local behavior at $(a,b)$
  as the function $f(x+a, y+b)-f(a,b)$ has at the origin.
  
  Consider the quadratic polynomial 
  \[
    p(x,y) = ax^2  + b xy + cy^2 + dx + ey, 
  \]
  where $a,b,c,d,e,f$ are real numbers.  Our goal is to determine
  whether $p$ has a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither, at
  each of its critical points. The main idea is to slice the graph of
  $p$ along a line passing through the critical point in the direction
  of an arbitrary vector $\mathbf{v} \in \R^2$. If $p$ has a local
  minimum along each of these lines, then it has a local minimum at
  the critical point.  If $p$ has a local maximum along each of these
  lines, then it has a local maximum at the critical point. If it has
  a local minimum in some directions and a local maximum in other
  directions, then it has neither a local min nor a local max at the
  critical point.
  
  Note that $d=e=0$, since $d$ and $e$ are the first-order partial
  derivatives of $p$ at the origin.  Fix a vector
  $\mathbf{v} = \langle v_1, v_2 \rangle$, and consider the function
  from $\R$ to $\R$ that maps $t$ to $p(v_1t, v_2 t)$. The shape of
  this function's graph is the same shape you get by slicing the graph
  of $p$ along a vertical plane containing $\mathbf{v}$ and passing
  through the critical point. We get
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:ptv}
    p(t v_1, t v_2) = t^2(av_1^2 + bv_1 v_2 + c v_2^2). 
  \end{equation}
  This single-variable function has a local min or max at $t=0$
  according to whether $av_1^2 + b v_1v_2 + c v_2^2$ is positive or
  negative. So,
  \begin{enumerate}[(a),itemsep = 4 pt, topsep = -6pt]
  \item if $av_1^2 + b v_1v_2 + c v_2^2$ is positive for all
    $\mathbf{v}$, then $f$ has a local minimum at the origin
  \item if $av_1^2 + b v_1v_2 + c v_2^2$ is negative for all
    $\mathbf{v}$, then $f$ has a local maximum at the origin, and
  \item if $av_1^2 + b v_1v_2 + c v_2^2$ is positive for some vectors
    $\mathbf{v}$ and negative for others, then $f$ has a saddle point.
  \end{enumerate}
  \sidenote{* To be complete, the case $v_1=0$ must be checked
    separately} We can determine whether
  $av_1^2 + b v_1v_2 + c v_2^2$ is always positive, always negative,
  or neither by assuming* that $v_1 \neq 0$, in which case we can
  define $m = v_2/v_1$ and rewrite the expression in the form
  $v_1^2(a + bm + cm^2)$. This expression, viewed as a quadratic
  function of $m$, is
  \begin{enumerate}[(a), topsep = -6pt, itemsep = 4pt]
  \item positive for all $m$ if and only if the discriminant
    $b^2 - 4ac$ is negative and $a > 0$,
  \item negative for all $m$ if and only if the discriminant
    $b^2 - 4ac$ is negative, and $a < 0$, and
  \item positive for some values of $m$ and negative for
    others if and only if $b^2 - 4ac$ is positive.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  By Taylor's theorem, $f$ can be written as
  \[
    f(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + R(x,y), 
  \]
  where $R$ is a function satisfying
  $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}\frac{R(x,y)}{|\langle x,y \rangle|^2} = 0$,
  and $a = \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial_x^2f)(0,0)$,
  $b = (\partial_x\partial_y f)(0,0)$, and
  $c = \tfrac{1}{2}(\partial_y^2f)(0,0)$. As we just figured out,
  $ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$ has a local min or max or saddle according to
  signs of $a$ and
  $b^2 - 4ac = [\partial_x\partial_y f(0,0)]^2 -
  \partial_x^2f(0,0)\partial_y^2 f(0,0)$. So the proof is done once we
  can show that the error term can be safely ignored. We will outline
  how to do this only for the case where $p(x,y) = ax^2 + bxy + cy^2$
  has a local minimum at the origin. The basic idea is that value of
  $p(x,y)$ is increasing quadratically in all directions from its
  value at the origin, and $R(x,y)$ isn't nearly large enough to
  cancel this increase.

  If we write an arbitrary point $(x,y)$ as
  $(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)$, then \eqref{eq:ptv} shows us that
  \[
    p(x,y) = (x^2+y^2)(a\cos^2 \theta + b \cos \theta \sin \theta +
    c \cos^2 \theta). 
  \]
  We've assumed we're in the case where
  $a\cos^2 \theta + b \cos \theta \sin \theta + c \sin^2 \theta$ is
  positive for all $\theta \in [0,2\pi]$. By the extreme value
  theorem, this quantity has some positive minimum value which we'll
  call $\alpha$.  Since
  $\lim_{(x,y) \to (0,0)}\frac{R(x,y)}{|\langle x,y \rangle|^2} = 0$, we
  know that $R(x,y) \geq -\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha(x^2+y^2)$ for $(x,y)$
  sufficiently close the origin. Therefore, for such $(x,y)$, we have
  \[
    f(x,y)  \geq \alpha(x^2 + y^2) + R(x,y) \geq
    \alpha(x^2 + y^2) - \frac{\alpha}{2}(x^2+y^2) > 0.
  \]
  Thus $f$ has a local minimum at the origin.

  \caption{The gradient of a function specifies the direction of

\end{wrapfigure}

You might have a couple different images come to mind when you think
about gradients, one with a vector which is tangent to a surface, and
the other with a vector normal to a surface. So is the gradient normal
or tangent? Both!* To specify the picture, we have to specify
\textit{what function} we're taking the gradient of, and \textit{what
  surface} our vector is tangent or normal to.  \sidenote{* Sort of:
  the tangent vector is only closely related to the gradient}[-5mm]

The most important idea is that the gradient of a function at a point
specifies its direction of maximum increase. This has two
implications:

(1) (Figure~\ref{fig:gradg}) If $g$ is a differentiable function from $\R^3$
to $\R^1$, then the gradient of $g$ is orthogonal to the \textbf{level
  surface} of $g$ at each point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$.

(2) (Figure~\ref{fig:gradf}) If $f$ is a differentiable function from
$\R^2$ to $\R^1$, then the gradient of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ tells us the
direction \textit{in the $xy$-plane} in which we should move so that
the point $(x,y,f(x,y))$ on the \textbf{graph} of $f$ moves in the
direction of maximum $z$ increase.* \sidenote{* If the graph of $f$
  corresponds to a hilly landscape, the gradient at each point only
  specifies the cardinal direction of maximum increase. The hiker
  moving in this direction naturally moves tangent to the hill,
  because gravity keeps them pinned to the graph}

In the second case, if we want a vector which is tangent to the graph
of $f$, we need to include the third component (since the gradient
only has two). This component should be chosen so that the vector is
contained within the plane tangent to the graph at that point, which
means we should substitute into the tangent plane equation
\[
  z - z_0 = (\partial_x f)(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0) +  (\partial_y
  f)(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0). 
\]
Substituting $x-x_0 = (\partial_x f)(x_0,y_0)$ and $y-y_0 =
(\partial_y f)(x_0,y_0)$, we find that the third component should be
the squared gradient of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$.

\subsection{The Riemann integral} \label{sec:riemannintegral} 

When we defined the integral of a function $f$ defined on a
two-dimensional region $D$ (Definition~\ref{eq:def2D}), some features
seemed a bit arbitrary: why did we choose $\tfrac1n$ for the box
width, as opposed to $\tfrac1{2^n}$ or some other expression which
converges to 0 as $n\to\infty$? Also, why did we evaluate the function
at the corner points $\left(\tfrac in, \tfrac jn\right)$? In this
section we present a more canonical definition of the Riemann
integral. Basically, the idea is to encompass all ways of subdividing
the region and choosing points in each subdivision.

Suppose that $D$ is contained in the box $[a,b] \times [c,d]$, and
that $f: D \to \R$ is a bounded function.  We define a
\textbf{partition} $P$ of $[a,b]$ to be a finite set of points between
$a$ and $b$, denoted $a = p_1 < p_2 < \cdots < p_m = b$. Similarly,
let $Q$ be a partition of $[c,d]$, denoted
$c = q_1 < q_2 < \ldots < q_n = d$.

For each pair $(i,j)$, we define $M_{i,j}$ to be the maximum value and
$m_{i,j}$ the minimum value of $f$ on
$[p_i,p_{i+1}] \times [q_j,q_{j+1}]$ (unless
$[p_i,p_{i+1}] \times [q_j,q_{j+1}]$ does not intersect $D$, in which
case we set $M_{i,j}$ and $m_{i,j}$ both to 0). We define the upper
Riemann sum $\overline{I}(f,P,Q)$ associated with the partitions $P$
and $Q$ by
\[
  \overline{I}(f, P,Q) = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n M_{i,j}(p_{i+1}- p_i)
  (q_{i+1}- q_i),
\]
and the lower Riemann sum by
\[
  \underline{I}(f, P,Q) = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n m_{i,j}(p_{i+1}- p_i)
  (q_{i+1}- q_i). 
\]
Clearly we will have $\underline{I}(f, P,Q) \leq \overline{I}(f, P,Q)$
for all partitions $P$ and $Q$, since $m_{i,j} \leq
M_{i,j}$. Furthermore, as we \textit{refine} the partitions $P$ and
$Q$ (that is, put more points in them), $\overline{I}(f, P,Q)$
decreases and $\underline{I}(f, P,Q)$ increases. Therefore, we are
motivated to define $\overline{\int}_D f \, \d A$ to be the number
that $\overline{I}(f, P,Q)$ decreases toward as $P$ and $Q$ get
increasingly fine---more precisely, we define
$\overline{\int}_D f \, \d A$ to be the greatest number which is less
than or equal to $\overline{I}(f, P,Q)$ for all partitions $P$ and
$Q$. Likewise, we define $\underline{\int}_D f \, \d A$ to be the
least number which is greater than or equal to $\underline{I}(f, P,Q)$
for all partitions $P$ and $Q$.

If  $\underline{\int}_D f \, \d A$ and $\overline{\int}_D f \, \d A$
are equal, we say that $f$ is \textbf{Riemann integrable} and define
its integral $\int_D f \, \d A$ to be the common value of
$\underline{\int}_D f \, \d A$ and $\overline{\int}_D f \, \d
A$. Otherwise, we say that the function is not Riemann
integrable.

\begin{theo}{}{}
  If $f:D \to \R$ is continuous and if the boundary of $D$ has area
  zero*, then $f$ is Riemann integrable. \sidenote{* Yes, this is
    pretty much always the case in practice: a region has to be pretty
    wild for its boundary to have positive area}
\end{theo}

\vspace{-4pt}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Assuming that $f$ is Riemann integrable, explain why the sum in
  Definition~\ref{eq:def2D} indeed converges to the value
  $\displaystyle{\int_D f \, \d A}$ defined in this section.

  $\overline{\int}_{[0,1]^2} f \, \d A$, and explain why $f$ is not
  Riemann integrable.

\subsection{How to solve math problems} \label{sec:solving}

Many of us have experienced a mode of solving math problems that goes
something like this: (1) see several similar examples solved out using
some sort of formula or sequence of steps, (2) pick up on cues to
recognize which numbers in the problem statement go where in the
solution frame, and (3) try our best to carry out these steps for the
problem at hand. Hopefully you've also experienced problem solving
that involves reasoning about the underlying ideas and tightly
integrates the manipulation of numbers and symbolic expressions with
the logical or physical or geometric concepts they represent. This
second mode is much more versatile, useful, and fun. Think of math
ideas as \textbf{tools, not templates}.

Becoming a composer requires developing facility with how individual
notes come together to make chords, and how notes and chords work
together to make music. Achieving such agency in the context of
mathematical problem solving, likewise, involves the incorporation of
individual techniques into your skill set and practice with weaving
them together to compose solutions.

Some practical tips: 
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=-4pt, itemsep=4pt]
\item Work \textbf{forwards and backwards}. Your goal in solving a
  math problem is to arrive at a conclusion based on some given
  data. It is often possible to work forwards from the given
  information \textit{and} to work backwards to simplify the desired
  conclusion. If you try one of these and get stuck, switch to the
  other, repeatedly if necessary. When you write up your final
  solution, however, it will flow better if you start at the beginning
  and reason your way to the end.
\item Ask \textbf{``what does this mean?''} often. A major part of the
  process of doing mathematics is packaging ideas into definitions and
  unpacking them. For example, if we're asked to show that $(0,1]$
  is equal to the range of the function $x\mapsto \frac{1}{1+x^2}$
  from $\R$ to $\R$, then the first question we need to answer is
  ``what does it mean to say that the range of a function is equal
  to a particular set?'' If we apply the definition of range to the
  function at hand, we get a concrete statement which is easier to
  approach.
\item Engage your \textbf{physical intuition} early and often
  throughout the problem solving process. Ask questions like
  \textit{can I tell if the final answer will be positive or
    negative?} and \textit{this expression increases as $t$
    increases; does that make sense in the context of the figure?} to
  establish frequent checks on your calculations and to develop your
  conceptual comprehension.
\item Make sure you \textbf{know the type and role} of each variable
  you use. For example, you might ask \textit{is $x$ a function or a
    vector or a number}? (In other words, what is its type?)
  \textit{Is $x$ an unknown that we are trying to solve for, or is
    it a dummy variable being used in the definition of a function
    or in the statement of an identity}? (In other words, what is
  its role?) To follow a plot line, it is essential to bear in mind
  basic information about the characters and how they relate to the
  story as a whole. It's the same with math.
\item \textbf{Don't be afraid} of dead ends or missteps. Interesting
  problems often require us to proceed without seeing how the
  subsequent steps of our solution are going to unfold. When you
  solve a jigsaw puzzle, you try pieces in lots of different places
  before your fragments begin to coalesce into a coherent
  whole. Trying things that don't work is part of the process.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{How to write a math solution} \label{sec:writing}

Whenever you write mathematics, including when you submit solutions
for homework or exams, your primary goal should be
\textbf{communication}. Specifically, you should bear in mind a reader
who is a fellow student in the course. This imagined reader will be
well acquainted with the ideas developed elsewhere in the course, but
they have not yet managed to solve the question at hand. Your writing
should contain enough reasoning and details to bring them comfortably
around to an understanding of your solution.

Furthermore, unless explicitly stated otherwise, your solutions should
be \textbf{complete}. This means that you have convincingly explained
why your assertions are true; there are no remaining holes that your
reader could poke in your argument. If you assumed at some point that
$x \neq -1$, for example, you should devote the necessary space to
addressing the possibility that $x = -1$. All problem statements
should be read with an implicit ``...and explain your reasoning''.

\begin{itemize}[itemsep=4pt] 
\item \textbf{Use complete sentences}. Writing in complete sentences
  helps your reader understand what you mean. This is as true for
  mathematical exposition as it is for prose. Find a way to
  incorporate your equations and expressions into sentences which
  properly contextualize them. A good rule of thumb is that all math
  notation (equations and expressions) should be incorporated into an
  English sentence.
\item \textbf{Focus on what's important}. Reflect on which steps in
  your solution are important to the overall flow of the solution and
  which steps are routine, and allocate space accordingly. For
  example, it's fine to say ``$\ldots$by the quadratic formula,
  $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$ implies $x = \tfrac{1\pm \sqrt{5}}{2}$.''
\item \textbf{Watch out for unquantified variables}. Quantifiers are
  phrases like ``there exists'' or ``for all'' which tell us how to
  interpret a variable in an equation. For example, consider the
  statement ``for all $x$, there exists $y$ such that $x^2 =
  4y$''. The same equation might appear in a completely different
  statement like ``for all $y \geq 0$, there exists at least one value
  of $x$ such that $x^2 = 4y$.'' Writing the equation $x^2 = 4y$
  without any quantifiers, therefore, does not communicate the meaning
  of the equation.
\item \textbf{Don't write too much}. If you're able to reach the
  desired conclusion in two steps, write those two steps clearly and
  leave it at that.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}{}{linerange} 
  Show that the range of the function $f:\R^2 \to \R^2$ defined by
  $f(x,y) = (2x + y, -4x - 2y)$ is a line in $\R^2$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}[title = Good solution] 
  The range of $f$ is the line $\ell = \{(s,t) \in \R^2 \,: \, t =
  -2s\}$. To establish this, we need to show that (i) for every pair $(s,t) \in
  \ell$, there is some point $(x,y) \in \R^2$ that $f$ maps to
  $(s,t)$, and (ii), the image under $f$ of every pair $(x,y) \in
  \R^2$  is in $\ell$.
  
  For (i), we note that for all points $(s,t)$, the point $(s/2,0)$
  maps to $(s,t)$ under $f$. For (ii), we note that
  $-2(2x + y) = -4x - 2y$ for all $x$ and $y$, so if $(s,t)$ is a
  point in $\R^2$ such that $(s,t) = f(x,y)$, then we have
  $t = -2s$. 
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[title = Solution that needs improvement] 
  line: $y = -2x$

  $-2(2x + y) \stackrel{\checkmark}{=} -4x  +2y$

  $(x/2 , 0) \mapsto (x,y)$
\end{solution}

The second solution is much less effective than the first. It requires
some inference to figure out what the equations are supposed to mean,
since they don't appear in the context of sentences. We're missing the
step where we unpack the definition of range and arrive at the two
statements that need to be checked. Furthermore, the variables that
appear there aren't quantified at all: are we talking about all $x$
and $y$, or some $x$ and $y$, or what? The biggest problem is that the
reasoning which binds together the equations is left up to the reader
to guess.

\begin{example}{}{}
  Find the minimum and maximum of the function $f: [0,2] \to \R$
  defined by $f(x) = x^2 - x$.
\end{example}

\begin{solution}[title=Good solution] 
  Since $[0,2]$ is closed and bounded, the extreme value theorem tells
  us that $f$ achieves a maximum value and a minimum
  value. Furthermore, by the first derivative test, each extremum
  occurs at either a critical point or an endpoint of the interval.

  To find the set of critical points of $f$, we set $f'(x) = 2x - 1$
  equal to zero and solve. The only solution to this equation is
  $x = \tfrac{1}{2}$. Therefore, the maximum and minimum values occur
  at some value in the set $\{0,\tfrac{1}{2}, 2\}$. Evaluating the
  function at each of these points gives 0, $-\tfrac{1}{4}$, and 2,
  respectively.

  So we conclude that the maximum value of the function is
  $\boxed{2}$, realized at $x=2$. The minimum value is
  $\boxed{-\tfrac{1}{4}}$, realized at $x = \tfrac{1}{2}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[title=Solution that needs improvement] 
  We differentiate $f(x)$ using the power rule: $2x-1$
  \begin{align*}
    2x - 1 &= 0 \\
    2x &= 1  \\
    \frac{2x}{2} &= \frac{1}{2}
  \end{align*}
  $x = \tfrac{1}{2}$. Then $f(0) = 0$ and $f(\tfrac{1}{2}) =
  -\tfrac{1}{4}$ and $f(2) = 2$. Min $-\tfrac{1}{4}$ Max $2$. 
\end{solution}

This solution is more readable than the needs-improvement solution to
Example~\ref{exam:linerange}, but it still focuses on the least
important ideas.  We don't need to see that linear equation written
out step by step. What we \textit{do} want to understand is why we're
setting the derivative equal to zero in the first place, how we know
it suffices to check the points $0, \tfrac{1}{2}$ and 2, etc. There is
also an issue with the way the equations are presented: there is no
logical connector from one equation to the next, and the sequence of
equations collectively is not incorporated into an English
sentence. This leaves the reader to guess the role played by these
equations.

The following documents present more detailed advice on writing good
solutions.

\subsection{Thinking about functions} \label{sec:whatisafunction}

If asked to write down some examples of functions, you might produce a
list like
\[
  \sin(x^2) \qquad \frac{1}{1-x-x^2} \qquad \e^{x}\ln \sin 2x \qquad
  8x - x^2 + x^{-1}
\]
By $\sin(x^2)$, for example, we mean ``the function that squares its
input and takes the sine of the result''. These are
\textit{elementary} functions, meaning that they can be written as a
composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations ($\times$,
$\div$, $+$, $-$), exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions
and their inverses, constants, and solutions of polynomial equations
(like square roots). Functions that can be defined purely using
expressions in this way make up a \textit{tiny} sliver of the set of
all functions: if we're defining a function on a domain $D$, we can
define $f(x)$ \textit{however we want} for each $x\in D$. Thinking of
functions in terms of expressions obscures this fact, because changing
the expression defining an elementary function changes many values of
the function simultaneously.

\begin{example}{}{straightlines}
  Show that there exists a continuous function from $[0,1]$ to $\R$
  which is equal to zero on the interval $[0.01,1]$ and satisfies the
  integral equation $\int_0^1 f(x) \, \d x = 3.21$.
\end{example}

\begin{lrbox}{\asybox}
  \begin{asy} 
    size(5cm);
    pair O = (0,0);
    draw(O--1.2*dir(0),gray,Arrow(4));
    draw(O--2.2*dir(90),gray,Arrow(4));
    
    real w = 0.08; real h = 2.0; 
    
    draw((0,0)--(w/2,h)--(w,0)--(1,0),MidnightBlue+linewidth(1.0)); 
    
    draw(Label("$1$",Relative(1),align=S),(1,0)--(1,-0.1),gray);
    draw(Label("$\frac{1}{100}$",Relative(1),align=S),(w,0)--(w,-0.1),gray);
    draw(Label("$642$",Relative(1),align=W),(0,h)--(-0.1,h),gray);
  \end{asy}
\end{lrbox}

\begin{solution}
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.78\textwidth} 
    Consider the path which begins at $(0,0)$, proceeds in a straight
    line to $(0.005,642)$, then in a straight line to $(0.01,0)$, and
    from there directly across to $(1,0)$. Every vertical line between
    $x=0$ and $x=1$ intersects this path exactly once; therefore, this
    path is the graph of a function. The area under the graph of this
    function is the area of a triangle with base $0.01$ and height
    642, so its area is indeed 3.21.
  \end{minipage} \hfill 
  \begin{minipage}[t]{0.20\textwidth}
    \raisebox{\dimexpr -\height + 1.5 ex \relax}{\usebox{\asybox}}
  \end{minipage}
\end{solution}

Note that in our solution to Example~\ref{exam:straightlines}, we
specified our function by drawing its graph rather than by giving a
formula. This flexibility is a powerful problem solving tool when it
comes to proving the existence of functions with desired properties.

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  Show that there exists a \textit{differentiable} function $[0,1]$ to
  $\R$ which is equal to zero on the interval $[0.01,1]$ and satisfies

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{}
  The intermediate value theorem states that if $f$ is a continuous
  function from $\R$ to $\R$, then for every interval
  $[a,b] \subset \R$ and for every value $y$ which is between $f(a)$

  that the continuity hypothesis is essential. In other words, show
  that there exists a discontinuous function which does not satisfy

\subsection{The central idea of integral calculus} \label{sec:centralidea}

Mass is an \textbf{additive} property of an object. This means that if
we subdivide the object into smaller pieces and sum their masses, we
get the same result as if we had measured the mass of the original
object. Many other quantities of interest in calculus are additive,
such as the length of a path, the area of a surface, the volume of a
3D region, the flow of a vector field across a surface, the integral
of a function over an interval or region, the moment of inertia,
torque, etc.

The central idea of integral calculus is that an additive property of
an object can be calculated by \textbf{subdividing the object into
  many tiny pieces}, approximating the quantity of interest for each
piece, summing the results, and letting the number of pieces go to
infinity to obtain an expression which is amenable to formal
integration techniques. There are two pretty amazing things that
happen here: (1) we end up with an \textit{exact} answer even though
our approach is based on approximations, and (2) performing the
integration ends up being far more tractable than working with the
approximating sums.

The force behind (2) is the fundamental theorem of calculus, which
provides a link between limits of approximating sums and the
often-quite-easy task of finding an antiderivative. But (1) typically
remains mysterious until one takes a course or reads a book in which
the hand-waving justifications of an introductory calculus course are
replaced with rigorous proofs. Nevertheless, the basic idea behind (1)
can be appreciated at an elementary level. It is helpful to begin by
considering what can go wrong. \sidenote{We will focus on integrating
  positive functions---the story requires modifications to accommodate
  functions which take on negative or zero values}

  \caption{The area under the step function approximates the area
    under the curve\label{fig:relerror}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Exercise~\ref{exer:cautionarytale} shows that some properties of $f_n$
can approximate those of $f$ quite poorly even if $f_n$ approximates
$f$ very well. What goes wrong here with this approximation is that
the \textbf{relative error} is large. In other words, the ratio of the
arc length of $f$ over a short interval and the arc length of the
approximating ``stairstep'' over that interval does not converge to 1
as the width of the interval is decreased to zero.

Contrast Exercise~\ref{exer:cautionarytale} with
Figure~\ref{fig:relerror}, which illustrates approximating the area
under the graph of $f$ with the area under $f_n$. In this case the
relative error of the approximation for each slice decreases to
zero. In other words, quotient of the green area and the red+green
area converges to 1 as the number of slices converges to infinity. By
Exercise~\ref{exer:relerror} below, this implies that the relative
error of the approximating sum converges to zero as the number of
steps goes to infinity. Therefore, the limit of the sequence of
approximating sums is exactly equal to the area under the curve.

\begin{exercise}{Small relative error for the part implies small
    relative error for the whole}{relerror}
  Let $\epsilon > 0$. Suppose that $A_i$ and $A_i'$, where $i$ ranges
  from $1$ to $n$, are positive numbers satisfying
  $1-\epsilon \leq \frac{A_{i}'}{A_{i}} \leq 1 + \epsilon$ for all $i$
  from $1$ to $n$. Show that
  $1-\epsilon \leq \frac{A_1'+\cdots+A_n'}{A_1+\cdots+A_n} \leq 1 +
  \epsilon$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{}{intrelerror}
  Verify that if $f:[a,b] \to (0,\infty)$ is a continuous function and
  $x_0 \in [a,b)$, then the quotient of the area under the graph of
  $f$ over $[x_0,x_0+h]$ and the area under the graph of the constant
  function $f(x_0)$ over $[a,b)$ converges to 1 as $h \to 0^+$.
\end{exercise}

The above discussion does omit some important details. For example,
Exercise~\ref{exer:relerror} stipulates that we achieve the same small
relative error $\epsilon$ across the whole interval, while in
Exercise~\ref{exer:intrelerror} we focus on each point $x_0$ one at a
time. Also, what if $f$ isn't assumed to be positive, and the area
under the curve over a particular short interval happens to be zero?

Despite these shortcomings, the relative error perspective can clarify
what's going on when we do our ``split it into many tiny
pieces'' derivations throughout the course.

  Math is
  more fun when you learn how to take advantage of computational
  resources to assist your learning. Some problem solving tasks are
  done much better by computers than people, and while in some cases
  it is important to gain facility with performing such calculations
  by hand, at some point you want to delegate tedious tasks to the
  computer and spend your time and attention on the more creative
  aspects of problem solving.  The open source project which has
  arguably made the most concerted and successful effort to be broadly
  useful to math students with minimal fuss is SageMath (or just
  Sage). You can use Sage in your browser without having to install
  anything. The webpage \url{sagecell.sagemath.org} doesn't require sign
  in, while \url{cocalc.com} gives you some hard drive space and saves
  your work. You
  can use Sage essentially as a calculator for many tasks. However, it is quite convenient if you
  need to do something more involved, since 
  Sage uses the beginner-friendly language Python. This is
  where Sage really shines in comparison to a query tool like
  Wolfram Alpha, which is great for one-liners but is not well-suited
  to several-step computations. 

  Here are some examples of calculations you can do with Sage. You
  have to tell it that you're going to use \texttt{x} as a symbol
  using the \texttt{var} function; you can declare several symbols in
  this way using spaces. The text following the hashtag is a comment
  and is ignored by Sage.

\begin{pythonblock}[title=]
> var("x y") # tell sage that you want to use x and y as symbols

-1/2*(cos(y) - sin(y))*e^y + 1/2*sqrt(x^2 + 1)*x + 1/2*arcsinh(x)

> limit(sin(x^2)/x^2,x=0) # find a limit
1

> cos(3*x).trig_expand() # work with trig functions
cos(x)^3 - 3*cos(x)*sin(x)^2

x^x*(log(x) + 1)

(x + 1)*(x - 1),
(x^2 + x + 1)*(x - 1),
(x^2 + 1)*(x + 1)*(x - 1),
(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)*(x - 1)]

  open a page at cocalc.com showing the result as well as the

    code snippets are in \href{http://julialang.org}{Julia}, which is a

\asubsection{sec:optim}

\begin{aexercise}
  For functions of one variable, it is impossible for a continuous
  function to have two local maxima and no local minimum: between
  every two peaks there must be a trough. Show, however, that the
  function
  \[
    f(x,y) = -(x^2-1)^2-(x^2y-x-1)^2
  \]
  has only two critical points and has a local maximum at each (!!). 
\end{aexercise}


\begin{aexercise}
  The Hessian of a twice-differentiable function $f:\R^2 \to \R$ is

        \partial_x\partial_y f & \partial_y^2 f
      \end{array}
    \right]. 
  \]
  The \textit{second derivative test} says that if $\det H(x,y) < 0$
  at a critical point $(x,y)$ then $f$ has neither local minimum nor a
  local maximum at $(x,y)$, and if $\det H(x,y) > 0$ then $f$ has a
  local minimum or a local maximum at $(x,y)$. The minimum and maximum
  cases are distinguished by whether the diagonal entries of $H$ are
  positive or negative, respectively.

\begin{aexercise}[enhanced, breakable] 
  A planimeter is a device used to calculate the area of a
  two-dimensional region. In this problem, we explore the mathematics
  behind how the planimeter works. 

  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{5cm}
      \includegraphics[width=3.5cm]{exercisefigures/planimeter.pdf}
    \end{minipage} \quad 
    \begin{minipage}{5cm}
      \includegraphics[width=5cm]{exercisefigures/myplanimeter.png}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}

  The pointer $P$ at one end of the planimeter follows the contour $C$
  of the surface $S$ to be measured. For the linear planimeter the
  movement of the ``elbow'' $E$ is restricted to the
  $y$-axis. Connected to the arm $PE$ is the measuring wheel with its
  axis of rotation parallel to $PE$. A movement of the arm $PE$ can be
  decomposed into a movement perpendicular to $PE$, causing the
  measuring wheel to rotate, and a movement parallel to $PE$, causing
  the measuring wheel to skid, with no contribution to its
  reading. You may assume that the length of $PE$ is 1 unit.

  Use Green's theorem to explain why the final reading on the
  measuring wheel is equal to the area of the surface $S$.

  Hints: (i) define $b(x,y)$ to be the $y$-coordinate of the point $E$
  when the needle is at $P = (x,y)$. Then (ii) find the component of
  $\langle \Delta x, \Delta y\rangle$ which is perpendicular to
  $\overrightarrow{EP}$ and use your result to set up a line integral
  whose value equals to final reading on the meter. Then (iii) show
  that that the value of line integral is equal to the desired
  area.
